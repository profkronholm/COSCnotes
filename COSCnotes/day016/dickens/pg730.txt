 pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words -- trusting that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated -- hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at his hands.Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong:which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a beadle properly constituted:that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his official capacity the parochial church:is, in right and virtue of his office, possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and that to none of those excellences, can mere companies' beadles, or court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest sustainable claim.#MrBumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs, made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he began to think that it was time for #MrsCorney to return. Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of #MrsCorney's approach, it occured to #MrB that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of #MrsCorney's chest of drawers.Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber, #MrB, beginning at the bottom, proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers: which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture, carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with dried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction.Arriving, in course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the key), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, #MrB returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old attitude, said, with a grave and determined air,'I'll do it!' He followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest.He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when #MrsCorney, hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the other over her heart, and gasped for breath.'#MrsCorney,' said #MrB, stooping over the matron,'what is this, ma'am?Has anything happened, ma'am?#Pray answer me: I'm on -- on --' #MrB, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the word'tenterhooks,' so he said'broken bottles.''Oh, Mr. #Bumble!' cried the lady,'I have been so dreadfully put out!''Put out, ma'am!' exclaimed #MrB;'who has dared to --?I know!' said #MrB, checking himself, with native majesty,'this is them wicious paupers!''It's dreadful to think of!' said the lady, shuddering.'Then _don't_ think of it, ma'am,' rejoined #MrB.'I ca n't help it,' whimpered the lady.'Then take something, ma'am,' said #MrB soothingly.'A little of the wine?''Not for the world!' replied #MrsCorney.'I could n't, -- oh!The top shelf in the right-hand corner -- oh!'Uttering these words, the good lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms.#MrBumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady's lips.'I'm better now,' said #MrsCorney, falling back, after drinking half of it.#MrBumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and, bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.'Peppermint,' exclaimed #MrsCorney, in a faint voice, smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke.'Try it!There's a little -- a little something else in it.'#MrBumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips; took another taste; and put the cup down empty.'It's very comforting,' said #MrsCorney.'Very much so indeed, ma'am,' said the beadle.As he spoke, he drew a chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her.'Nothing,' replied #MrsCorney.'I am a foolish, excitable, weak creetur.''Not weak, ma'am,' retorted #MrB, drawing his chair a little closer.'Are you a weak creetur, #MrsCorney?''We are all weak creeturs,' said #MrsCorney, laying down a general principle.'So we are,' said the beadle.#Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the expiration of that time, #MrB had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of #MrsCorney's chair, where it had previously rested, to #MrsCorney's apron-string, round which it gradually became entwined.'We are all weak creeturs,' said #MrB.#MrsCorney sighed.'Do n't sigh, #MrsCorney,' said #MrB.'I ca n't help it,' said #MrsCorney.And she sighed again.'This is a very comfortable room, ma'am,' said #MrB looking round.'Another room, and this, ma'am, would be a complete thing.''It would be too much for one,' murmured the lady.'But not for two, ma'am,' rejoined #MrB, in soft accents.'Eh, #MrsCorney?'#MrsCorney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle drooped his, to get a view of #MrsCorney's face.#MrsCorney, with great propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at her pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of #MrB.'The board allows you coals, do n't they, #MrsCorney?' inquired the beadle, affectionately pressing her hand.'And candles,' replied #MrsCorney, slightly returning the pressure.'Coals, candles, and house-rent free,' said #MrB.'Oh, #MrsCorney, what an Angel you are!'The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling.She sank into #MrB's arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose.'Such porochial perfection!' exclaimed #MrB, rapturously.'You know that #MrS is worse to-night, my fascinator?''Yes,' replied #MrsCorney, bashfully.'He ca n't live a week, the doctor says,' pursued #MrB.'He is the master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that wacancy must be filled up.Oh, #MrsCorney, what a prospect this opens!What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!'#MrsCorney sobbed.'The little word?' said #MrB, bending over the bashful beauty.'The one little, little, little word, my blessed #Corney?''Ye -- ye -- yes!' sighed out the matron.'One more,' pursued the beadle;'compose your darling feelings for only one more.When is it to come off?'#MrsCorney twice essayed to speak:and twice failed.At length summoning up courage, she threw her arms around #MrB's neck, and said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was'a irresistible duck.'Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture; which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of the lady's spirits.While it was being disposed of, she acquainted #MrB with the old woman's decease.'Very good,' said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint;'I'll call at #Sowerberry's as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning.Was it that as frightened you, love?''It was n't anything particular, dear,' said the lady evasively.'It must have been something, love,' urged #MrB.'Wo n't you tell your own B.?''Not now,' rejoined the lady;'one of these days.After we're married, dear.''After we're married!' exclaimed #MrB.'It was n't any impudence from any of them male paupers as --''No, no, love!' interposed the lady, hastily.'If I thought it was,' continued #MrB;'if I thought as any one of'em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance --''They would n't have dared to do it, love,' responded the lady.'They had better not!' said #MrB, clenching his fist.'Let me see any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I can tell him that he would n't do it a second time!'Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed no very high compliment to the lady's charms; but, as #MrB accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched with this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration, that he was indeed a dove.The dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat; and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few minutes, in the male paupers' ward, to abuse them a little, with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse-master with needful acerbity. Assured of his qualifications, #MrB left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion:which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker.Now, #Mr. and #MrsSowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and #NoahClaypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up.#MrBumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but, attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what was going forward, he was not a little surprised.The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. At the upper end of the table, #MrN lolled negligently in an easy-chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other. #Close beside him stood #Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which #MrC condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity.A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman's nose, and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever, could have sufficiently accounted.'Here's a delicious fat one, #Noah, dear!' said #Charlotte;'try him, do; only this one.''What a delicious thing is a oyster!' remarked #MrC, after he had swallowed it.'What a pity it is, a number of'em should ever make you feel uncomfortable; is n't it, #Charlotte?''It's quite a cruelty,' said #Charlotte.'So it is,' acquiesced #MrC.'A n't yer fond of oysters?''Not overmuch,' replied #Charlotte.'I like to see you eat'em, #Noah dear, better than eating'em myself.''Lor!' said #Noah, reflectively;'how queer!''Have another,' said #Charlotte.'Here's one with such a beautiful, delicate beard!''I ca n't manage any more,' said #Noah.'I'm very sorry.Come here, #Charlotte, and I'll kiss yer.''What!' said #MrB, bursting into the room.'Say that again, sir.'#Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron.#MrC, without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken terror.'Say it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!' said #MrB.'How dare you mention such a thing, sir?And how dare you encourage him, you insolent minx?#Kiss her!' exclaimed #MrB, in strong indignation.'Faugh!''I did n't mean to do it!' said #Noah, blubbering.'She's always a-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.''Oh, #Noah,' cried #Charlotte, reproachfully.'Yer are; yer know yer are!' retorted #Noah.'She's always a-doin' of it, #MrB, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and makes all manner of love!''Silence!' cried #MrB, sternly.'Take yourself downstairs, ma'am.#Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that #MrB said he was to send a old woman's shell after breakfast to-morrow morning.Do you hear sir?Kissing!' cried #MrB, holding up his hands.'The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful!If #Parliament do n't take their abominable courses under consideration, this country's ruined, and the character of the peasantry gone for ever!'With these words, the beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker's premises.And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have made all necessary preparations for the old woman's funeral, let us set on foot a few inquires after young #OliverTwist, and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where #TobyCrackit left him.CHAPTER #XXVIIILOOKS AFTER #OLIVER, AND #PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES'Wolves tear your throats!' muttered #Sikes, grinding his teeth.'I wish I was among some of you; you'd howl the hoarser for it.'As #Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an instant, to look back at his pursuers.There was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in every direction.'Stop, you white-livered hound!' cried the robber, shouting after #TobyCrackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead.'Stop!'The repetition of the word, brought #Toby to a dead stand-still. For he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot; and #Sikes was in no mood to be played with.'Bear a hand with the boy,' cried #Sikes, beckoning furiously to his confederate.'Come back!'#Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along.'Quicker!' cried #Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and drawing a pistol from his pocket.'Do n't play booty with me.'At this moment the noise grew louder.Sikes, again looking round, could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them.'It's all up, #Bill!' cried #Toby;'drop the kid, and show'em your heels.'With this parting advice, #MrC, preferring the chance of being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed.#Sikes clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form of #Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone.'Ho, ho, there!' cried a tremulous voice in the rear.'Pincher! Neptune!Come here, come here!'The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily answered to the command.Three men, who had by this time advanced some distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together.'My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my _orders_, is,' said the fattest man of the party,'that we'mediately go home again.''I am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to #MrG,' said a shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very pale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are.'I should n't wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,' said the third, who had called the dogs back,'Mr. #Giles ought to know.''Certainly,' replied the shorter man;'and whatever #MrG says, it is n't our place to contradict him.No, no, I know my sitiwation! Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.'To tell the truth, the little man _did_ seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke.'You are afraid, #Brittles,' said #MrG.'I a n't,' said #Brittles.'You are,' said #Giles.'You're a falsehood, #MrG,' said #Brittles.'You're a lie, #Brittles,' said #MrG.Now, these four retorts arose from #MrG's taunt; and #MrG's taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment. The third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically.'I'll tell you what it is, gentlemen,' said he,'we're all afraid.''Speak for yourself, sir,' said #MrG, who was the palest of the party.'So I do,' replied the man.'It's natural and proper to be afraid, under such circumstances.I am.''So am I,' said #Brittles;'only there's no call to tell a man he is, so bounceably.'These frank admissions softened #MrG, who at once owned that _he_ was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again with the completest unanimity, until #MrG (who had the shortest wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech.'But it's wonderful,' said #MrG, when he had explained,'what a man will do, when his blood is up.I should have committed murder -- I know I should -- if we'd caught one of them rascals.'As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament.'I know what it was,' said #MrG;'it was the gate.''I should n't wonder if it was,' exclaimed #Brittles, catching at the idea.'You may depend upon it,' said #Giles,'that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement.I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was climbing over it.'By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment.It was quite obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance.This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse, and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in the pursuit.#MrGiles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion; #Brittles was a lad of all-work: who, having entered her service a mere child, was treated as a promising young boy still, though he was something past thirty.Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round, whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried back to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire.Catching up the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot; and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne.The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke.The grass was wet; the pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning.Still, #Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where #Sikes had left him.Morning drew on apace.The air become more sharp and piercing, as its first dull hue -- the death of night, rather than the birth of day -- glimmered faintly in the sky.The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes.The rain came down, thick and fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes.But, #Oliver felt it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his bed of clay.At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and uttering it, the boy awoke.His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl, hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with blood.He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help, and groaned with pain.Trembling in every joint, from cold and exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged, Oliver:urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die:got upon his feet, and essayed to walk. His head was dizzy, and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man.But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with his head drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew not whither.And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind.He seemed to be still walking between #Sikes and #Crackit, who were angrily disputing -- for the very words they said, sounded in his ears; and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some violent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was talking to them. Then, he was alone with #Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber's grasp upon his wrist. Suddenly, he started back at the report of firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away.Through all these rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented him incessantly.Thus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars of gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way, until he reached a road.Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused him.He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house, which perhaps he could reach.Pitying his condition, they might have compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought, to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields.He summoned up all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps towards it.As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had seen it before.He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him.That garden wall!On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last night, and prayed the two men's mercy.It was the very house they had attempted to rob.#Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that, for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of flight.#Flight!He could scarcely stand:and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame, whither could he fly?He pushed against the garden-gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on its hinges.He tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico.It happened that about this time, #MrG, #Brittles, and the tinker, were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen.Not that it was #MrG's habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants: towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society.But, death, fires, and burglary, make all men equals; so #MrG sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while, with his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery, to which his bearers (but especially the cook and housemaid, who were of the party) listened with breathless interest.'It was about half-past two,' said #MrG,'or I would n't swear that it might n't have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and, turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here #MrG turned round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him to imitate bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.'At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the housemaid to shut the door: who asked #Brittles, who asked the tinker, who pretended not to hear.' -- Heerd a noise,' continued #MrG.'I says, at first, ``This is illusion''; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the noise again, distinct.''What sort of a noise?' asked the cook.'A kind of a busting noise,' replied #MrG, looking round him.'More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,' suggested #Brittles.'It was, when _you_ heerd it, sir,' rejoined #MrG;'but, at this time, it had a busting sound.I turned down the clothes'; continued #Giles, rolling back the table-cloth,'sat up in bed; and listened.'The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated'Lor!' and drew their chairs closer together.'I heerd it now, quite apparent,' resumed #MrG.''' Somebody,'' I says, ``is forcing of a door, or window; what's to be done? I'll call up that poor lad, #Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed; or his throat,'' I says, ``may be cut from his right ear to his left, without his ever knowing it.'''Here, all eyes were turned upon #Brittles, who fixed his upon the speaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror.'I tossed off the clothes,' said #Giles, throwing away the table-cloth, and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid,'got softly out of bed; drew on a pair of --''Ladies present, #MrG,' murmured the tinker.' -- Of _shoes_, sir,' said #Giles, turning upon him, and laying great emphasis on the word;'seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room. ``Brittles,'' I says, when I had woke him, ``do n't be frightened!''''So you did,' observed #Brittles, in a low voice.''' We're dead men, I think, #Brittles,'' I says,' continued #Giles;''' but do n't be frightened.''''_Was_ he frightened?' asked the cook.'Not a bit of it,' replied #MrG.'He was as firm -- ah! pretty near as firm as I was.''I should have died at once, I'm sure, if it had been me,' observed the housemaid.'You're a woman,' retorted #Brittles, plucking up a little.'Brittles is right,' said #MrG, nodding his head, approvingly;'from a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a dark lantern that was standing on #Brittle's hob, and groped our way downstairs in the pitch dark, -- as it might be so.'#MrGiles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried back to his chair.The cook and housemaid screamed.'It was a knock,' said #MrG, assuming perfect serenity.'Open the door, somebody.'#Nobody moved.'It seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in the morning,' said #MrG, surveying the pale faces which surrounded him, and looking very blank himself;'but the door must be opened.Do you hear, somebody?'#MrGiles, as he spoke, looked at #Brittles; but that young man, being naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he tendered no reply. #MrG directed an appealing glance at the tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep.The women were out of the question.'If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,' said #MrG, after a short silence,'I am ready to make one.''So am I,' said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen asleep.#Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat re-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front. The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear.By the advice of #MrG, they all talked very loud, to warn any evil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by a master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman, the dogs' tails were well pinched, in the hall, to make them bark savagely.These precautions having been taken, #MrG held on fast by the tinker's arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and gave the word of command to open the door.#Brittles obeyed; the group, peeping timorously over each other's shoulders, beheld no more formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their compassion.'A boy!' exclaimed #MrG, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the background.'What's the matter with the -- eh? -- Why -- #Brittles -- look here -- do n't you know?'#Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw #Oliver, than he uttered a loud cry.#MrGiles, seizing the boy by one leg and one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the hall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof.'Here he is!' bawled #Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up the staircase;'here's one of the thieves, ma'am! Here's a thief, miss! #Wounded, miss!I shot him, miss; and #Brittles held the light.'' -- In a lantern, miss,' cried #Brittles, applying one hand to the side of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better.The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that #MrG had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore #Oliver, lest he should die before he could be hanged.In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant.'Giles!' whispered the voice from the stair-head.'I'm here, miss,' replied #MrG.'Do n't be frightened, miss; I ai n't much injured.He did n't make a very desperate resistance, miss! I was soon too many for him.''Hush!' replied the young lady;'you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did.Is the poor creature much hurt?''Wounded desperate, miss,' replied #Giles, with indescribable complacency.'He looks as if he was a-going, miss,' bawled #Brittles, in the same manner as before.'Would n't you like to come and look at him, miss, in case he should?''Hush, pray; there's a good man!' rejoined the lady.'Wait quietly only one instant, while I speak to aunt.'With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped away.She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to #MrG's room; and that #Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey:from which place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a constable and doctor.'But wo n't you take one look at him, first, miss?' asked #MrG, with as much pride as if #Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he had skilfully brought down.'Not one little peep, miss?''Not now, for the world,' replied the young lady.'Poor fellow! Oh! treat him kindly, #Giles for my sake!'The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child.Then, bending over #Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and solicitude of a woman.CHAPTER #XXIXHAS AN #INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE #INMATES OF #THE #HOUSE, TO #WHICH OLIVER RESORTEDIn a handsome room:though its furniture had rather the air of old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance:there sat two ladies at a well-spread breakfast-table.#MrGiles, dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them.He had taken his station some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table; and, with his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand thrust into his waist-coat, while his left hung down by his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance.Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she.Dressed with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the table before her.Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were attentively upon her young companion.The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood; at that age, when, if ever angels be for #God's good purposes enthroned in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such as hers.She was not past seventeen.#Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions.The very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for #Home, and fireside peace and happiness.She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. Chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her.'And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?' asked the old lady, after a pause.'An hour and twelve minutes, ma'am,' replied #MrG, referring to a silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon.'He is always slow,' remarked the old lady.'Brittles always was a slow boy, ma'am,' replied the attendant. And seeing, by the bye, that #Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one.'He gets worse instead of better, I think,' said the elder lady.'It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys,' said the young lady, smiling.#MrGiles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process, burst into the room, and nearly overturned #MrG and the breakfast-table together.'I never heard of such a thing!' exclaimed the fat gentleman.'My dear #MrsMaylie -- bless my soul -- in the silence of the night, too -- I _never_ heard of such a thing!'With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found themselves.'You ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,' said the fat gentleman.'Why did n't you send?Bless me, my man should have come in a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or anybody, I'm sure, under such circumstances.#Dear, dear!So unexpected!In the silence of the night, too!'The doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two previous.'And you, #MissRose,' said the doctor, turning to the young lady,'I --''Oh! very much so, indeed,' said #Rose, interrupting him;'but there is a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.''Ah! to be sure,' replied the doctor,'so there is.That was your handiwork, #Giles, I understand.'#MrGiles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights, blushed very red, and said that he had had that honour.'Honour, eh?' said the doctor;'well, I do n't know; perhaps it's as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at twelve paces.#Fancy that he fired in the air, and you've fought a duel, #Giles.'#MrGiles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was not for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party.'Gad, that's true!' said the doctor.'Where is he?Show me the way. I'll look in again, as I come down, #MrsMaylie.That's the little window that he got in at, eh?#Well, I could n't have believed it!'Talking all the way, he followed #MrG upstairs; and while he is going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that #MrL, a surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as'the doctor,' had grown fat, more from good-humour than from good living:and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any explorer alive.The doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated.A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above.At length he returned; and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the door, carefully.'This is a very extraordinary thing, #MrsMaylie,' said the doctor, standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut.'He is not in danger, I hope?' said the old lady.'Why, that would _not_ be an extraordinary thing, under the circumstances,' replied the doctor;'though I do n't think he is. Have you seen the thief?''No,' rejoined the old lady.'Nor heard anything about him?''No.''I beg your pardon, ma'am, interposed #MrG;'but I was going to tell you about him when #DoctorLosberne came in.'The fact was, that #MrG had not, at first, been able to bring his mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy.Such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him, help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during which he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage.'Rose wished to see the man,' said #MrsMaylie,'but I would n't hear of it.''Humph!' rejoined the doctor.'There is nothing very alarming in his appearance.Have you any objection to see him in my presence?''If it be necessary,' replied the old lady,'certainly not.''Then I think it is necessary,' said the doctor;'at all events, I am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you postponed it.He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow me -- #MissRose, will you permit me?Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my honour!'CHAPTER #XXXRELATES WHAT #OLIVER'S #NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIMWith many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady's arm through one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to #MrsMaylie, led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs.'Now,' said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of a bedroom-door,'let us hear what you think of him.He has not been shaved very recently, but he do n't look at all ferocious notwithstanding.#Stop, though!Let me first see that he is in visiting order.'Stepping before them, he looked into the room.Motioning them to advance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the curtains of the bed.Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child:worn with pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep.His wounded arm, bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over the pillow.The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a minute or so, in silence.Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the bedside, gathered #Oliver's hair from his face.As she stooped over him, her tears fell upon his forehead.The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known.Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.'What can this mean?' exclaimed the elder lady.'This poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers!''Vice,' said the surgeon, replacing the curtain,'takes up her abode in many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her?''But at so early an age!' urged #Rose.'My dear young lady,' rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his head;'crime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered alone.The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.''But, can you -- oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?' said #Rose.The surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.'But even if he has been wicked,' pursued #Rose,'think how young he is; think that he may never have known a mother's love, or the comfort of a home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt.#Aunt, dear aunt, for mercy's sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment.Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too late!''My dear love,' said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom,'do you think I would harm a hair of his head?''Oh, no!' replied #Rose, eagerly.'No, surely,' said the old lady;'my days are drawing to their close: and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to save him, sir?''Let me think, ma'am,' said the doctor;'let me think.'#MrLosberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his toes, and frowning frightfully.After various exclamations of'I've got it now' and'no, I have n't,' and as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:'I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully #Giles, and that little boy, #Brittles, I can manage it.Giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides.You do n't object to that?''Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,' replied #MrsMaylie.'There is no other,' said the doctor.'No other, take my word for it.''Then my aunt invests you with full power,' said #Rose, smiling through her tears;'but pray do n't be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary.''You seem to think,' retorted the doctor,'that everybody is disposed to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, #MissRose. I only hope, for the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for doing so, as the present.''You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,' returned #Rose, blushing.'Well,' said the doctor, laughing heartily,'that is no very difficult matter.But to return to this boy.The great point of our agreement is yet to come.He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he mus n't be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse with him without danger.Now I make this stipulation -- that I shall examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at all events.''Oh no, aunt!' entreated #Rose.'Oh yes, aunt!' said the doctor.'Is is a bargain?''He can not be hardened in vice,' said #Rose;'It is impossible.''Very good,' retorted the doctor;'then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition.'Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to wait, with some impatience, until #Oliver should awake.The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than #MrL had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and still #Oliver slumbered heavily.It was evening, indeed, before the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to.The boy was very ill, he said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning: which he should otherwise have done.The conference was a long one.#Oliver told them all his simple history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him.Oh! if when we oppress and grind our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is true, but not less surely, to #Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of dead men's voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day's life brings with it!#Oliver's pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept.He felt calm and happy, and could have died without a murmur.The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and #Oliver composed to rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon #MrG.And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen; so into the kitchen he went.There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament, the women-servants, #MrB, #MrG, the tinker (who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day, in consideration of his services), and the constable.The latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and large half-boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale -- as indeed he had.The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for #MrG was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered; #MrB, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything, before his superior said it.'Sit still!' said the doctor, waving his hand.'Thank you, sir, said #MrG.'Misses wished some ale to be given out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir, and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among'em here.'#Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from #MrG's condescension.#MrGiles looked round with a patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly, he would never desert them.'How is the patient to-night, sir?' asked #Giles.'So-so'; returned the doctor.'I am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there, Mr. #Giles.''I hope you do n't mean to say, sir,' said #MrG, trembling,'that he's going to die.If I thought it, I should never be happy again.I would n't cut a boy off:no, not even #Brittles here; not for all the plate in the county, sir.''That's not the point,' said the doctor, mysteriously.'Mr. #Giles, are you a #Protestant?''Yes, sir, I hope so,' faltered #MrG, who had turned very pale.'And what are _you_, boy?' said the doctor, turning sharply upon #Brittles.'Lord bless me, sir!' replied #Brittles, starting violently;'I'm the same as #MrG, sir.''Then tell me this,' said the doctor,'both of you, both of you! Are you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night?Out with it!Come!We are prepared for you!'The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger, that #Giles and #Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.'Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?' said the doctor, shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy's utmost acuteness.'Something may come of this before long.'The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner.'It's a simple question of identity, you will observe,' said the doctor.'That's what it is, sir,' replied the constable, coughing with great violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone the wrong way.'Here's the house broken into,' said the doctor,'and a couple of men catch one moment's glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness.Here's a boy comes to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him -- by doing which, they place his life in great danger -- and swear he is the thief.Now, the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in what situation do they place themselves?'The constable nodded profoundly.He said, if that was n't law, he would be glad to know what was.'I ask you again,' thundered the doctor,'are you, on your solemn oaths, able to identify that boy?'#Brittles looked doubtfully at #MrG; #MrG looked doubtfully at #Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment, the sound of wheels.'It's the runners!' cried #Brittles, to all appearance much relieved.'The what?' exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.'The #BowStreet officers, sir,' replied #Brittles, taking up a candle;'me and #MrG sent for'em this morning.''What?' cried the doctor.'Yes,' replied #Brittles;'I sent a message up by the coachman, and I only wonder they were n't here before, sir.''You did, did you?Then confound your -- slow coaches down here; that's all,' said the doctor, walking away.CHAPTER #XXXIINVOLVES A #CRITICAL POSITION'Who's that?' inquired #Brittles, opening the door a little way, with the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand.'Open the door,' replied a man outside;'it's the officers from #BowStreet, as was sent to to-day.'Much comforted by this assurance, #Brittles opened the door to its full width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he lived there.'Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?' said the officer;'he's in the gig, a-minding the prad.Have you got a coach'us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?'Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his companion to put up the gig:while #Brittles lighted them, in a state of great admiration.This done, they returned to the house, and, being shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed like what they were.The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close; half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes.The other was a red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose.'Tell your governor that #Blathers and #Duff is here, will you?' said the stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table.'Oh!Good-evening, master.Can I have a word or two with you in private, if you please?'This was addressed to #MrL, who now made his appearance; that gentleman, motioning #Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and shut the door.'This is the lady of the house,' said #MrL, motioning towards #MrsMaylie.#MrBlathers made a bow.Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to #Duff to do the same.The latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or quite so much at his ease in it -- one of the two -- seated himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment.'Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,' said #Blathers.'What are the circumstances?'#MrL, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at great length, and with much circumlocution.Messrs. #Blathers and #Duff looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod.'I ca n't say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,' said #Blathers;'but my opinion at once is, -- I do n't mind committing myself to that extent, -- that this was n't done by a yokel; eh, #Duff?''Certainly not,' replied #Duff.'And, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a countryman?' said #MrL, with a smile.'That's it, master,' replied #Blathers.'This is all about the robbery, is it?''All,' replied the doctor.'Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking on?' said #Blathers.'Nothing at all,' replied the doctor.'One of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house; but it's nonsense: sheer absurdity.''Wery easy disposed of, if it is,' remarked #Duff.'What he says is quite correct,' observed #Blathers, nodding his head in a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if they were a pair of castanets.'Who is the boy? What account does he give of himself?Where did he come from? He did n't drop out of the clouds, did he, master?''Of course not,' replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two ladies.'I know his whole history: but we can talk about that presently.You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves made their attempt, I suppose?''Certainly,' rejoined #MrB.'We had better inspect the premises first, and examine the servants afterwards. That's the usual way of doing business.'Lights were then procured; and Messrs. #Blathers and #Duff, attended by the native constable, #Brittles, #Giles, and everybody else in short, went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with.This done, amidst the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and #MrG and #Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous night's adventures: which they performed some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the last.This consummation being arrived at, #Blathers and #Duff cleared the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine, would be mere child's play.Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state; and #MrsMaylie and #Rose looked on, with anxious faces.'Upon my word,' he said, making a halt, after a great number of very rapid turns,'I hardly know what to do.''Surely,' said #Rose,'the poor child's story, faithfully repeated to these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.''I doubt it, my dear young lady,' said the doctor, shaking his head.'I do n't think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal functionaries of a higher grade.What is he, after all, they would say?A runaway.Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his story is a very doubtful one.''You believe it, surely?' interrupted #Rose.'_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for doing so,' rejoined the doctor;'but I do n't think it is exactly the tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.''Why not?' demanded #Rose.'Because, my pretty cross-examiner,' replied the doctor:'because, viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well. Confound the fellows, they _will_ have the why and the wherefore, and will take nothing for granted.On his own showing, you see, he has been the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman's pocket; he has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman's house, to a place which he can not describe or point out, and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea.He is brought down to #Chertsey, by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him! As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself! Do n't you see all this?''I see it, of course,' replied #Rose, smiling at the doctor's impetuosity;'but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the poor child.''No,' replied the doctor;'of course not!Bless the bright eyes of your sex!They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to them.'Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before.'The more I think of it,' said the doctor,'the more I see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boy's real story.I am certain it will not be believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery.''Oh! what is to be done?' cried #Rose.'Dear, dear! why did they send for these people?''Why, indeed!' exclaimed #MrsMaylie.'I would not have had them here, for the world.''All I know is,' said #MrL, at last:sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness,'that we must try and carry it off with a bold face.The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse.The boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be talked to any more; that's one comfort.We must make the best of it; and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours.Come in!''Well, master,' said #Blathers, entering the room followed by his colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more.'This war n't a put-up thing.''And what the devil's a put-up thing?' demanded the doctor, impatiently.'We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,' said #Blathers, turning to them, as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor's,'when the servants is in it.''Nobody suspected them, in this case,' said #MrsMaylie.'Wery likely not, ma'am,' replied #Blathers;'but they might have been in it, for all that.''More likely on that wery account,' said #Duff.'We find it was a town hand,' said #Blathers, continuing his report;'for the style of work is first-rate.''Wery pretty indeed it is,' remarked #Duff, in an undertone.'There was two of'em in it,' continued #Blathers;'and they had a boy with'em; that's plain from the size of the window.That's all to be said at present.We'll see this lad that you've got upstairs at once, if you please.''Perhaps they will take something to drink first, #MrsMaylie?' said the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred to him.'Oh! to be sure!' exclaimed #Rose, eagerly.'You shall have it immediately, if you will.''Why, thank you, miss!' said #Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve across his mouth;'it's dry work, this sort of duty.#Anythink that's handy, miss; do n't put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.''What shall it be?' asked the doctor, following the young lady to the sideboard.'A little drop of spirits, master, if it's all the same,' replied #Blathers.'It's a cold ride from #London, ma'am; and I always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.'This interesting communication was addressed to #MrsMaylie, who received it very graciously.While it was being conveyed to her, the doctor slipped out of the room.'Ah!' said #Mr. Blathers:not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand: and placing it in front of his chest;'I have seen a good many pieces of business like this, in my time, ladies.''That crack down in the back lane at #Edmonton, #Blathers,' said #MrD, assisting his colleague's memory.'That was something in this way, war n't it?' rejoined #MrB;'that was done by #ConkeyChickweed, that was.''You always gave that to him' replied Duff.'It was the #FamilyPet, I tell you.#Conkey had n't any more to do with it than I had.''Get out!' retorted #MrB;'I know better.Do you mind that time when #Conkey was robbed of his money, though?What a start that was!Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see!''What was that?' inquired Rose:anxious to encourage any symptoms of good-humour in the unwelcome visitors.'It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down upon,' said #Blathers.'This here #Conkey Chickweed --''Conkey means #Nosey, ma'am,' interposed #Duff.'Of course the lady knows that, do n't she?' demanded #MrB.'Always interrupting, you are, partner!This here #ConkeyChickweed, miss, kept a public-house over #Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar, where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I've seen'em off'en.He war n't one of the family, at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window:which was only a story high. He was wery quick about it.But #Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about'em, found that #Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost'em.However, he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of #MrC, licensed witler, appeared in the #Gazette among the other bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I do n't know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. One day he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and orders #JemSpyers in (#Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go and assist #MrC in apprehending the man as robbed his house. ``I see him, #Spyers,'' said #Chickweed, ``pass my house yesterday morning,'' ``Why did n't you up, and collar him!'' says #Spyers.``I was so struck all of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,'' says the poor man; ``but we're sure to have him; for between ten and eleven o'clock at night he passed again.''Spyers no sooner heard this, than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment's notice. He was smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed roars out, ``Here he is! Stop thief!#Murder!''#Jem #Spyers dashes out; and there he sees #Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry.#Away goes #Spyers; on goes #Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars out, ``Thieves!'' and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time, like mad.Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner; shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; ``Which is the man?'' ``D -- me!'' says #Chickweed, ``I've lost him again!''It was a remarkable occurrence, but he war n't to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the public-house. Next morning, #Spyers took his old place, and looked out, from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye, till his own two eyes ached again.At last, he could n't help shutting'em, to ease'em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears #Chickweed a-roaring out, ``Here he is!''Off he starts once more, with #Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as the yesterday's one, the man's lost again!This was done, once or twice more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that #MrC had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him arterwards; and the other half, that poor #MrC had gone mad with grief.''What did #JemSpyers say?' inquired the doctor; who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story.'Jem Spyers,' resumed the officer,'for a long time said nothing at all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he understood his business.But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and taking out his snuffbox, says ``#Chickweed, I've found out who done this here robbery.''``Have you?'' said #Chickweed.``Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented!Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the villain!''``Come!'' said #Spyers, offering him a pinch of snuff, ``none of that gammon!You did it yourself.''So he had; and a good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have found it out, if he had n't been so precious anxious to keep up appearances!' said #MrB, putting down his wine-glass, and clinking the handcuffs together.'Very curious, indeed,' observed the doctor.'Now, if you please, you can walk upstairs.''If _you_ please, sir,' returned #MrB.Closely following #MrL, the two officers ascended to #Oliver's bedroom; #MrG preceding the party, with a lighted candle.#Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he had appeared yet.Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forward -- in fact, without seeming to recollect where he was, or what had been passing.'This,' said #MrL, speaking softly, but with great vehemence notwithstanding,'this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a spring-gun in some boyish trespass on #Mr. What-d' ye-call-him's grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand:who has placed his life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.'Messrs. #Blathers and #Duff looked at #MrG, as he was thus recommended to their notice.The bewildered butler gazed from them towards #Oliver, and from #Oliver towards #MrL, with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.'You do n't mean to deny that, I suppose?' said the doctor, laying #Oliver gently down again.'It was all done for the -- for the best, sir,' answered #Giles.'I am sure I thought it was the boy, or I would n't have meddled with him.I am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.''Thought it was what boy?' inquired the senior officer.'The housebreaker's boy, sir!' replied #Giles.'They -- they certainly had a boy.''Well?Do you think so now?' inquired #Blathers.'Think what, now?' replied #Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner.'Think it's the same boy, Stupid-head?' rejoined #Blathers, impatiently.'I do n't know; I really do n't know,' said #Giles, with a rueful countenance.'I could n't swear to him.''What do you think?' asked #MrB.'I do n't know what to think,' replied poor Giles.'I do n't think it is the boy; indeed, I'm almost certain that it is n't.You know it ca n't be.''Has this man been a-drinking, sir?' inquired #Blathers, turning to the doctor.'What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!' said #Duff, addressing #MrG, with supreme contempt.#MrLosberne had been feeling the patient's pulse during this short dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked, that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would perhaps like to step into the next room, and have #Brittles before them.Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment, where #MrB, being called in, involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed, his declarations that he should n't know the real boy, if he were put before him that instant; that he had only taken #Oliver to be he, because #MrG had said he was; and that #MrG had, five minutes previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty.Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether #MrG had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before. #Upon no one, however, did it make a greater impression than on #MrG himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost.Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very much about #Oliver, left the #Chertsey constable in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next morning.With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in the cage at #Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances; and to #Kingston Messrs. Blathers and #Duff journeyed accordingly. The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the #English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King's subjects, held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and #Duff came back again, as wise as they went.In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of #MrsMaylie and #MrL for #Oliver's appearance if he should ever be called upon; and #Blathers and #Duff, being rewarded with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the #FamilyPet; and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great #MrC.Meanwhile, #Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of #MrsMaylie, #Rose, and the kind-hearted #MrL.If fervent prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven -- and if they be not, what prayers are! -- the blessings which the orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and happiness.CHAPTER #XXXIIOF #THE #HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS #KIND FRIENDS#Oliver's ailings were neither slight nor few.In addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague:which hung about him for many weeks, and reduced him sadly. But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something to show his gratitude; only something, which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something, however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul.'Poor fellow!' said #Rose, when #Oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips;'you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will. We are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us.The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days.We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.''The trouble!' cried #Oliver.'Oh! dear lady, if I could but work for you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make you happy; what would I give to do it!''You shall give nothing at all,' said #MissMaylie, smiling;'for, as I told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me very happy indeed.''Happy, ma'am!' cried #Oliver;'how kind of you to say so!''You will make me happier than I can tell you,' replied the young lady.'To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence, would delight me, more than you can well imagine.Do you understand me?' she inquired, watching #Oliver's thoughtful face.'Oh yes, ma'am, yes!' replied #Oliver eagerly;'but I was thinking that I am ungrateful now.''To whom?' inquired the young lady.'To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of me before,' rejoined #Oliver.'If they knew how happy I am, they would be pleased, I am sure.''I am sure they would,' rejoined #Oliver's benefactress;'and #MrL has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.''Has he, ma'am?' cried #Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure.'I do n't know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once again!'In a short time #Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition.One morning he and #MrL set out, accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to #MrsMaylie.When they came to #ChertseyBridge, #Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a loud exclamation.'What's the matter with the boy?' cried the doctor, as usual, all in a bustle.'Do you see anything -- hear anything -- feel anything -- eh?''That, sir,' cried #Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window.'That house!''Yes; well, what of it?#Stop coachman.#Pull up here,' cried the doctor.'What of the house, my man; eh?''The thieves -- the house they took me to!' whispered #Oliver.'The devil it is!' cried the doctor.'Hallo, there! let me out!'But, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.'Halloa?' said a little ugly hump-backed man:opening the door so suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick, nearly fell forward into the passage.'What's the matter here?''Matter!' exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment's reflection.'A good deal.#Robbery is the matter.''There'll be Murder the matter, too,' replied the hump-backed man, coolly,'if you do n't take your hands off.Do you hear me?''I hear you,' said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake.'Where's -- confound the fellow, what's his rascally name -- #Sikes; that's it.Where's #Sikes, you thief?'The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor's grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the house.Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour, without a word of parley.He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the cupboards; answered #Oliver's description!'Now!' said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly,'what do you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to rob me, or to murder me?Which is it?''Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair, you ridiculous old vampire?' said the irritable doctor.'What do you want, then?' demanded the hunchback.'Will you take yourself off, before I do you a mischief?Curse you!''As soon as I think proper,' said #MrL, looking into the other parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to #Oliver's account of it.'I shall find you out, some day, my friend.''Will you?' sneered the ill-favoured cripple.'If you ever want me, I'm here.I have n't lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty years, to be scared by you.You shall pay for this; you shall pay for this.'And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage.'Stupid enough, this,' muttered the doctor to himself;'the boy must have made a mistake.Here!Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself up again.'With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money, and returned to the carriage.The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way; but as #MrL turned to speak to the driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed #Oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months afterwards.He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until the driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their way, they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage.'I am an ass!' said the doctor, after a long silence.'Did you know that before, #Oliver?''No, sir.''Then do n't forget it another time.''An ass,' said the doctor again, after a further silence of some minutes.'Even if it had been the right place, and the right fellows had been there, what could I have done, single-handed? And if I had had assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I have hushed up this business. That would have served me right, though. I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on impulse.It might have done me good.'Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him.If the truth must be told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of #Oliver's story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any.He soon came round again, however; and finding that #Oliver's replies to his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that time forth.As #Oliver knew the name of the street in which #MrB resided, they were enabled to drive straight thither.When the coach turned into it, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his breath.'Now, my boy, which house is it?' inquired #MrL.'That!That!' replied #Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window.'The white house.Oh! make haste!#Pray make haste! I feel as if I should die: it makes me tremble so.''Come, come!' said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder.'You will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well.''Oh!I hope so!' cried #Oliver.'They were so good to me; so very, very good to me.'The coach rolled on.It stopped.No; that was the wrong house; the next door.It went on a few paces, and stopped again. #Oliver looked up at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.#Alas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window.'To Let.''Knock at the next door,' cried #MrL, taking #Oliver's arm in his.'What has become of #MrB, who used to live in the adjoining house, do you know?'The servant did not know; but would go and inquire.She presently returned, and said, that #MrB had sold off his goods, and gone to the #WestIndies, six weeks before.#Oliver clasped his hands, and sank feebly backward.'Has his housekeeper gone too?' inquired #MrL, after a moment's pause.'Yes, sir'; replied the servant.'The old gentleman, the housekeeper, and a gentleman who was a friend of #MrB's, all went together.''Then turn towards home again,' said #MrL to the driver;'and do n't stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded #London!''The book-stall keeper, sir?' said #Oliver.'I know the way there.See him, pray, sir!Do see him!''My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,' said the doctor.'Quite enough for both of us.If we go to the book-stall keeper's, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house on fire, or run away.No; home again straight!'And in obedience to the doctor's impulse, home they went.This bitter disappointment caused #Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times during his illness, with thinking of all that #MrB and #MrsBedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them. The hope of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he had been forced away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many of his recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so far, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robber -- a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day -- was almost more than he could bear.The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of his benefactors.After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house at #Chertsey, for some months.Sending the plate, which had so excited #Fagin's cupidity, to the banker's; and leaving #Giles and another servant in care of the house, they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took #Oliver with them.Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green hills and rich woods, of an inland village!Who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded hearts!Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of #Nature's face; and, carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being.Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight!The memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes. Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved:may purify our thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it.It was a lovely spot to which they repaired.#Oliver, whose days had been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there.The rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours.#Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at rest.#Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen; but, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly, but without pain.It was a happy time.The days were peaceful and serene; the nights brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts.Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman, who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to write:and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that #Oliver could never try enough to please him.Then, he would walk with #MrsMaylie and #Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters. Then, he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them: listening with such pleasure to all they said:and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it. When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear. There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and #Oliver would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a perfect rapture.And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way in which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the other days in that most happy time!There was the little church, in the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows:the birds singing without:and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance. The poor people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical (to #Oliver's ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before.Then, there were the walks as usual, and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, #Oliver read a chapter or two from the #Bible, which he had been studying all the week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself.In the morning, #Oliver would be a-foot by six o'clock, roaming the fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the embellishment of the breakfast-table. There was fresh groundsel, too, for #MissMaylie's birds, with which #Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the most approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which #Oliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who was a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until #MissRose made her appearance:when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done.So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled happiness, and which, in #Oliver's were true felicity. With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, #OliverTwist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself.CHAPTER #XXXIIIWHEREIN THE #HAPPINESSOF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A #SUDDEN CHECKSpring flew swiftly by, and summer came.If the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness.The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond.The earth had donned her mantle of brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad.It was the prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates.#Oliver had long since grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people.He was still the same gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him.One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them:for the day had been unusually warm, and there was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually refreshing.#Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds.#MrsMaylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly home.The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual.After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping.'Rose, my dear!' said the elder lady.#Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts.'Rose, my love!' cried #MrsMaylie, rising hastily, and bending over her.'What is this?In tears!My dear child, what distresses you?''Nothing, aunt; nothing,' replied the young lady.'I do n't know what it is; I ca n't describe it; but I feel --''Not ill, my love?' interposed #MrsMaylie.'No, no!Oh, not ill!' replied #Rose: shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her, while she spoke;'I shall be better presently.Close the window, pray!'#Oliver hastened to comply with her request.The young lady, making an effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune; but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her face with her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress.'My child!' said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her,'I never saw you so before.''I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,' rejoined #Rose;'but indeed I have tried very hard, and can not help this. I fear I _am_ ill, aunt.'She was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn before.Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush:and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye.Again this disappeared, like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly pale.#Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and they so far succeeded, that when #Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in better health:assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning, quite well.'I hope,' said #Oliver, when #MrsMaylie returned,'that nothing is the matter?She do n't look well to-night, but --'The old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length, she said, in a trembling voice:'I hope not, #Oliver.I have been very happy with her for some years: too happy, perhaps.It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune; but I hope it is not this.''What?' inquired #Oliver.'The heavy blow,' said the old lady,'of losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness.''Oh!#God forbid!' exclaimed #Oliver, hastily.'Amen to that, my child!' said the old lady, wringing her hands.'Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?' said #Oliver.'Two hours ago, she was quite well.''She is very ill now,' rejoined #MrsMaylies;'and will be worse, I am sure.My dear, dear Rose!Oh, what shall I do without her!'She gave way to such great grief, that #Oliver, suppressing his own emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that, for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.'And consider, ma'am,' said #Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary.'Oh! consider how young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her.I am sure -- certain -- quite certain -- that, for your sake, who are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she makes so happy; she will not die.Heaven will never let her die so young.''Hush!' said #MrsMaylie, laying her hand on #Oliver's head.'You think like a child, poor boy.But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding.I had forgotten it for a moment, #Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love.I have seen enough, too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for #Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy. #God's will be done!I love her; and He knows how well!'#Oliver was surprised to see that as #MrsMaylie said these words, she checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up as she spoke, became composed and firm.He was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and watching which ensued, #MrsMaylie was ever ready and collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her, steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully.But he was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances.How should he, when their possessors so seldom know themselves?An anxious night ensued.When morning came, #MrsMaylie's predictions were but too well verified.#Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever.'We must be active, #Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,' said #MrsMaylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into his face;'this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to #MrL.It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more than four miles off, by the footpath across the field:and thence dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to #Chertsey. The people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I know.'#Oliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.'Here is another letter,' said #MrsMaylie, pausing to reflect;'but whether to send it now, or wait until I see how #Rose goes on, I scarcely know.I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.''Is it for #Chertsey, too, ma'am?' inquired #Oliver; impatient to execute his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.'No,' replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. #Oliver glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to #HarryMaylie, #Esquire, at some great lord's house in the country; where, he could not make out.'Shall it go, ma'am?' asked #Oliver, looking up, impatiently.'I think not,' replied #MrsMaylie, taking it back.'I will wait until to-morrow.'With these words, she gave #Oliver her purse, and he started off, without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work:nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a few seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and covered with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town.Here he paused, and looked about for the inn.There were a white bank, and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was a large house, with all the wood about it painted green:before which was the sign of'The #George.'To this he hastened, as soon as it caught his eye.He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking his teeth with a silver toothpick.This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill:which took a long time making out:and after it was ready, and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which took up ten good minutes more.Meanwhile #Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the next stage.At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and that no time had been lost, #Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a somewhat lighter heart.He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at that moment coming out of the inn door.'Hah!' cried the man, fixing his eyes on #Oliver, and suddenly recoiling.'What the devil's this?''I beg your pardon, sir,' said #Oliver;'I was in a great hurry to get home, and did n't see you were coming.''Death!' muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes.'Who would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He'd start up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!''I am sorry,' stammered #Oliver, confused by the strange man's wild look.'I hope I have not hurt you!''Rot you!' murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his clenched teeth;'if I had only had the courage to say the word, I might have been free of you in a night.Curses on your head, and black death on your heart, you imp!What are you doing here?'The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He advanced towards #Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him, but fell violently on the ground:writhing and foaming, in a fit.#Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help.Having seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards, running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time:and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory.#Rose #Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was delirious.A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he had taken #MrsMaylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature.'In fact,' he said,'it would be little short of a miracle, if she recovered.'How often did #Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber!How often did a tremble shake his frame, and cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had even then occurred!And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave's verge!Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance!Oh! the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time, allay them!Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time; women and children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for hours after it had grown dark, #Oliver paced softly up and down the garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay stretched inside.Late that night, #MrL arrived.'It is hard,' said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke;'so young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.'Another morning.The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy, surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting fast.#Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence.There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively occurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that graves were for cold and cheerless winter:not for sunlight and fragrance. He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds.A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts. Another!Again!It was tolling for the funeral service.A group of humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse was young.They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother -- a mother once -- among the weeping train.But the sun shone brightly, and the birds sang on.#Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was.He had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of thought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been.We need be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so little done -- of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might have been repaired!There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this, in time.When he reached home #MrsMaylie was sitting in the little parlour. #Oliver's heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away.He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which she would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell, and die.They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours.The untasted meal was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure.Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep.They both involuntarily darted to the door, as #MrL entered.'What of #Rose?' cried the old lady.'Tell me at once!I can bear it; anything but suspense!Oh, tell me! in the name of #Heaven!''You must compose yourself,' said the doctor supporting her.'Be calm, my dear ma'am, pray.''Let me go, in #God's name!My dear child!She is dead! She is dying!''No!' cried the doctor, passionately.'As He is good and merciful, she will live to bless us all, for years to come.'The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but the energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her.CHAPTER #XXXIVCONTAINS SOME #INTRODUCTORY #PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A #YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW #ARRIVES UPON THE #SCENE; AND A #NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO OLIVERIt was almost too much happiness to bear.#Oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak, or rest.He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.The night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward:laden with flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of the sick chamber.As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace.Looking round, he saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him.As it dashed on, #Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap, whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person.In another second or two, the nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop:which he did, as soon as he could pull up his horses.Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same voice called #Oliver by his name.'Here!' cried the voice.'Oliver, what's the news?#Miss #Rose! #Master O-li-ver!''Is is you, #Giles?' cried #Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.#Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply, when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.'In a word!' cried the gentleman,'Better or worse?''Better -- much better!' replied #Oliver, hastily.'Thank Heaven!' exclaimed the gentleman.'You are sure?''Quite, sir,' replied #Oliver.'The change took place only a few hours ago; and #MrL says, that all danger is at an end.'The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door, leaped out, and taking #Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.'You are quite certain?There is no possibility of any mistake on your part, my boy, is there?' demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice.'Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.''I would not for the world, sir,' replied #Oliver.'Indeed you may believe me.#MrLosberne's words were, that she would live to bless us all for many years to come.I heard him say so.'The tears stood in #Oliver's eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away, and remained silent, for some minutes.#Oliver thought he heard him sob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark -- for he could well guess what his feelings were -- and so stood apart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay.All this time, #MrG, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with white spots.That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him.'I think you had better go on to my mother's in the chaise, #Giles,' said he.'I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I see her.You can say I am coming.''I beg your pardon, #MrH,' said Giles:giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief;'but if you would leave the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you.It would n't be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should never have any more authority with them if they did.''Well,' rejoined #HarryMaylie, smiling,'you can do as you like. Let him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us. Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering, or we shall be taken for madmen.'#MrGiles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and pocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape, which he took out of the chaise.This done, the postboy drove off; #Giles, #MrM, and #Oliver, followed at their leisure.As they walked along, #Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer.He seemed about five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and prepossessing.Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age, he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that #Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not already spoken of her as his mother.#MrsMaylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage.The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides.'Mother!' whispered the young man;'why did you not write before?''I did,' replied #MrsMaylie;'but, on reflection, I determined to keep back the letter until I had heard #MrL's opinion.''But why,' said the young man,'why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened?If #Rose had -- I can not utter that word now -- if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have forgiven yourself!How could I ever have know happiness again!''If that _had_ been the case, #Harry,' said #MrsMaylie,'I fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little import.''And who can wonder if it be so, mother?' rejoined the young man;'or why should I say, _if_? -- It is -- it is -- you know it, mother -- you must know it!''I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer,' said #MrsMaylie;'I know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and lasting.If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.''This is unkind, mother,' said #Harry.'Do you still suppose that I am a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?''I think, my dear son,' returned #MrsMaylie, laying her hand upon his shoulder,'that youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more fleeting.Above all, I think' said the lady, fixing her eyes on her son's face,'that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against him:he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent of the connection he formed in early life.And she may have the pain of knowing that he does so.''Mother,' said the young man, impatiently,'he would be a selfish brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe, who acted thus.''You think so now, #Harry,' replied his mother.'And ever will!' said the young man.'The mental agony I have suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have lightly formed.On #Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman.I have no thought, no view, no hope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind.#Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little.''Harry,' said #MrsMaylie,'it is because I think so much of warm and sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. But we have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.''Let it rest with #Rose, then,' interposed #Harry.'You will not press these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle in my way?''I will not,' rejoined #MrsMaylie;'but I would have you consider --''I _have_ considered!' was the impatient reply;'Mother, I have considered, years and years.I have considered, ever since I have been capable of serious reflection.My feelings remain unchanged, as they ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent, which can be productive of no earthly good?No!Before I leave this place, #Rose shall hear me.''She shall,' said #MrsMaylie.'There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly, mother,' said the young man.'Not coldly,' rejoined the old lady;'far from it.''How then?' urged the young man.'She has formed no other attachment?''No, indeed,' replied his mother;'you have, or I mistake, too strong a hold on her affections already.What I would say,' resumed the old lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak,'is this.Before you stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child, on #Rose's history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision:devoted as she is to us, with all the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her characteristic.''What do you mean?''That I leave you to discover,' replied #MrsMaylie.'I must go back to her.God bless you!''I shall see you again to-night?' said the young man, eagerly.'By and by,' replied the lady;'when I leave #Rose.''You will tell her I am here?' said #Harry.'Of course,' replied #MrsMaylie.'And say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how I long to see her.You will not refuse to do this, mother?''No,' said the old lady;'I will tell her all.'And pressing her son's hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room.#MrLosberne and #Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding.The former now held out his hand to #HarryMaylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them.The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient's situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as #Oliver's statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, #MrG, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy ears.'Have you shot anything particular, lately, #Giles?' inquired the doctor, when he had concluded.'Nothing particular, sir,' replied #MrG, colouring up to the eyes.'Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?' said the doctor.'None at all, sir,' replied #MrG, with much gravity.'Well,' said the doctor,'I am sorry to hear it, because you do that sort of thing admirably.#Pray, how is #Brittles?''The boy is very well, sir,' said #MrG, recovering his usual tone of patronage;'and sends his respectful duty, sir.''That's well,' said the doctor.'Seeing you here, reminds me, #MrG, that on the day before that on which I was called away so hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small commission in your favour.Just step into this corner a moment, will you?'#MrGiles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder, and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with steps of unusual stateliness.The subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it; for #MrG walked straight thither, and having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of five-and-twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit.At this, the two women-servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that #MrG, pulling out his shirt-frill, replied,'No, no'; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank them to tell him so.And then he made a great many other remarks, no less illustrative of his humility, which were received with equal favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to the purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are.Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful #HarryMaylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the worthy gentleman's good humour, which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and made #Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy. So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they could well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.#Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days.The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places; and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more gathered to gladden #Rose with their beauty. The melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic.The dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright. Such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects.Men who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts.The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision.It is worthy of remark, and #Oliver did not fail to note it at the time, that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. #HarryMaylie, after the very first morning when he met #Oliver coming laden home, was seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind.If #Oliver were behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and brought home the fairest that blossomed.The window of the young lady's chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was made up with great care, every morning.#Oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most expressively, as he set forth on his morning's walk.Pending these observations, the days were flying by; and #Rose was rapidly recovering.#Nor did #Oliver's time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now and then, for a short distance, with #MrsMaylie. He applied himself, with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself.It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence.The little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his books, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house.It was quite a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the place with their delicious perfume.It looked into a garden, whence a wicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine meadow-land and wood.There was no other dwelling near, in that direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive.One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth, #Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his books.He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had been uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say, that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep.There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure.So far as an overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two.#Nor is this, the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state.It is an undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the _mere silent presence_ of some external object; which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes:and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness.#Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside.And yet he was asleep. Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the #Jew's house again. There sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at him, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat beside him.'Hush, my dear!' he thought he heard the Jew say;'it is he, sure enough.Come away.''He!' the other man seemed to answer;'could I mistake him, think you? If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to point him out.If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across his grave, I fancy I should know, if there was n't a mark above it, that he lay buried there?'The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that #Oliver awoke with the fear, and started up.#Good Heaven!what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move! There -- there -- at the window -- close before him -- so close, that he could have almost touched him before he started back:with his eyes peering into the room, and meeting his:there stood the Jew!And beside him, white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the inn-yard.It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they were gone.But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply carved in stone, and set before him from his birth. He stood transfixed for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called loudly for help.CHAPTER #XXXVCONTAINING #THE #UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER'S #ADVENTURE; AND A #CONVERSATIONOF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN #HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSEWhen the inmates of the house, attracted by #Oliver's cries, hurried to the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated, pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely able to articulate the words,'The Jew! the Jew!'#MrGiles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but #HarryMaylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard #Oliver's history from his mother, understood it at once.'What direction did he take?' he asked, catching up a heavy stick which was standing in a corner.'That,' replied #Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken;'I missed them in an instant.''Then, they are in the ditch!' said #Harry.'Follow!And keep as near me, as you can.' So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to keep near him.#Giles followed as well as he could; and #Oliver followed too; and in the course of a minute or two, #MrL, who had been out walking, and just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader, striking off into an angle of the field indicated by #Oliver, began to search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time for the remainder of the party to come up; and for #Oliver to communicate to #MrL the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit.The search was all in vain.There were not even the traces of recent footsteps, to be seen.They stood now, on the summit of a little hill, commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles. There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain that, after pursuing the track #Oliver had pointed out, the men must have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could have accomplished in so short a time.A thick wood skirted the meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that covert for the same reason.'It must have been a dream, #Oliver,' said #HarryMaylie.'Oh no, indeed, sir,' replied #Oliver, shuddering at the very recollection of the old wretch's countenance;'I saw him too plainly for that.I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.''Who was the other?' inquired #Harry and #MrL, together.'The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the inn,' said #Oliver.'We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I could swear to him.''They took this way?' demanded Harry:'are you sure?''As I am that the men were at the window,' replied #Oliver, pointing down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from the meadow.'The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.'The two gentlemen watched #Oliver's earnest face, as he spoke, and looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what he said.Still, in no direction were there any appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight.The grass was long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had crushed it.The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but in no one place could they discern the print of men's shoes, or the slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before.'This is strange!' said #Harry.'Strange?' echoed the doctor.'Blathers and #Duff, themselves, could make nothing of it.'Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance. #Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village, furnished with the best description #Oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the strangers.Of these, the Jew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen drinking, or loitering about; but #Giles returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but with no better success.On the day following, #Oliver and #MrM repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless.After a few days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.Meanwhile, #Rose was rapidly recovering.She had left her room: was able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the hearts of all.But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon some there:even upon #Rose herself: which #Oliver could not fail to remark.#MrsMaylie and her son were often closeted together for a long time; and more than once #Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face.After #MrL had fixed a day for his departure to #Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady, and of somebody else besides.At length, one morning, when #Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour, #HarryMaylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to speak with her for a few moments.'A few -- a very few -- will suffice, #Rose,' said the young man, drawing his chair towards her.'What I shall have to say, has already presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.'#Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might have been the effect of her recent illness.She merely bowed; and bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed.'I -- I -- ought to have left here, before,' said #Harry.'You should, indeed,' replied #Rose.'Forgive me for saying so, but I wish you had.''I was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all apprehensions,' said the young man;'the fear of losing the one dear being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed.You had been dying; trembling between earth and heaven.We know that when the young, the beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know, #Heaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.'There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred naturally, with the loveliest things in nature.'A creature,' continued the young man, passionately,'a creature as fair and innocent of guile as one of #God's own angels, fluttered between life and death.Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to the sorrow and calamity of this!#Rose, #Rose, to know that you were passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved you -- these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were mine, by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears, and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in its course.You recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a high and rushing tide.I have watched you change almost from death, to life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep affection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has softened my heart to all mankind.''I did not mean that,' said #Rose, weeping;'I only wish you had left here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to pursuits well worthy of you.''There is no pursuit more worthy of me:more worthy of the highest nature that exists:than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,' said the young man, taking her hand.'Rose, my own dear #Rose!For years -- for years -- I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy's attachment, and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed between us!That time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the offer.''Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.' said #Rose, mastering the emotions by which she was agitated.'As you believe that I am not insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.''It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?''It is,' replied #Rose,'that you must endeavour to forget me; not as your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply; but, as the object of your love.#Look into the world; think how many hearts you would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some other passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most faithful friend you have.'There was a pause, during which, #Rose, who had covered her face with one hand, gave free vent to her tears.#Harry still retained the other.'And your reasons, #Rose,' he said, at length, in a low voice;'your reasons for this decision?''You have a right to know them,' rejoined #Rose.'You can say nothing to alter my resolution.It is a duty that I must perform.I owe it, alike to others, and to myself.''To yourself?''Yes, #Harry.I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless, girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects.I owe it to you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.''If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty --' #Harry began.'They do not,' replied #Rose, colouring deeply.'Then you return my love?' said #Harry.'Say but that, dear #Rose; say but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!''If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,' rejoined #Rose,'I could have --''Have received this declaration very differently?' said #Harry.'Do not conceal that from me, at least, #Rose.''I could,' said #Rose.'Stay!' she added, disengaging her hand,'why should we prolong this painful interview?Most painful to me, and yet productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it _will_ be happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude and firmness.#Farewell, #Harry!As we have met to-day, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!''Another word, #Rose,' said #Harry.'Your reason in your own words. From your own lips, let me hear it!''The prospect before you,' answered #Rose, firmly,'is a brilliant one. All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men in public life, are in store for you. But those connections are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well supplied that mother's place.In a word,' said the young lady, turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her,'there is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads.I will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest alone on me.''One word more, #Rose.#Dearest #Rose! one more!' cried #Harry, throwing himself before her.'If I had been less -- less fortunate, the world would call it -- if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny -- if I had been poor, sick, helpless -- would you have turned from me then?Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple birth?''Do not press me to reply,' answered #Rose.'The question does not arise, and never will.It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.''If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,' retorted #Harry,'it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the path before me.It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else. Oh, #Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this one question!''Then, if your lot had been differently cast,' rejoined #Rose;'if you had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement, and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I should have been spared this trial.I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now; but then, #Harry, I own I should have been happier.'#Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded into the mind of #Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they relieved her.'I can not help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,' said #Rose, extending her hand.'I must leave you now, indeed.''I ask one promise,' said #Harry.'Once, and only once more, -- say within a year, but it may be much sooner, -- I may speak to you again on this subject, for the last time.''Not to press me to alter my right determination,' replied #Rose, with a melancholy smile;'it will be useless.''No,' said #Harry;'to hear you repeat it, if you will -- finally repeat it!I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not seek, by word or act, to change it.''Then let it be so,' rejoined #Rose;'it is but one pang the more, and by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.'She extended her hand again.But the young man caught her to his bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the room.CHAPTER #XXXVIIS A #VERY SHORT ONE, AND #MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE #READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A #SEQUEL TO THE LAST, AND A #KEY TO ONE THAT #WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES'And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning; eh?' said the doctor, as #HarryMaylie joined him and #Oliver at the breakfast-table.'Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two half-hours together!''You will tell me a different tale one of these days,' said #Harry, colouring without any perceptible reason.'I hope I may have good cause to do so,' replied #MrL;'though I confess I do n't think I shall.But yesterday morning you had made up your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side. #Before noon, you announce that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go, on your road to #London.And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all kinds. Too bad, is n't it, #Oliver?''I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and #MrM went away, sir,' rejoined #Oliver.'That's a fine fellow,' said the doctor;'you shall come and see me when you return.But, to speak seriously, #Harry; has any communication from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone?''The great nobs,' replied #Harry,'under which designation, I presume, you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among them.''Well,' said the doctor,'you are a queer fellow.But of course they will get you into parliament at the election before #Christmas, and these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life.There's something in that.#Good training is always desirable, whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.'#Harry #Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but he contented himself with saying,'We shall see,' and pursued the subject no farther.The post-chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards; and #Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out, to see it packed.'Oliver,' said #HarryMaylie, in a low voice,'let me speak a word with you.'#Oliver walked into the window-recess to which #MrM beckoned him; much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his whole behaviour displayed.'You can write well now?' said #Harry, laying his hand upon his arm.'I hope so, sir,' replied #Oliver.'I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would write to me -- say once a fort-night:every alternate Monday: to the #GeneralPost Office in #London.Will you?''Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,' exclaimed #Oliver, greatly delighted with the commission.'I should like to know how -- how my mother and #MissMaylie are,' said the young man;'and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you take, and what you talk about, and whether she -- they, I mean -- seem happy and quite well. You understand me?''Oh! quite, sir, quite,' replied #Oliver.'I would rather you did not mention it to them,' said #Harry, hurrying over his words;'because it might make my mother anxious to write to me oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret between you and me; and mind you tell me everything!I depend upon you.'#Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance, faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications. #MrM took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and protection.The doctor was in the chaise; #Giles (who, it had been arranged, should be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants were in the garden, looking on.#Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed window, and jumped into the carriage.'Drive on!' he cried,'hard, fast, full gallop!Nothing short of flying will keep pace with me, to-day.''Halloa!' cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great hurry, and shouting to the postillion;'something very short of flying will keep pace with _me_.Do you hear?'Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible, and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or the intricacies of the way, permitted.It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed.And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away; for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when #Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.'He seems in high spirits and happy,' she said, at length.'I feared for a time he might be otherwise.I was mistaken.I am very, very glad.'Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down #Rose's face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.CHAPTER #XXXVIIIN WHICH THE #READER MAY PERCEIVE A #CONTRAST, #NOT UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES#MrBumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which were sent back from its cold and shining surface.A paper fly-cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work, #MrB would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance.#MrBumble was meditating; it might be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own past life.#Nor was #MrB's gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not wanting other appearances, and those closely connected with his own person, which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs.The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they?He still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs; but they were not _the_ breeches.The coat was wide-skirted; and in that respect like _the_ coat, but, oh how different!The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one.#MrBumble was no longer a beadle.There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them.A field-marshal has his uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle his cocked hat.Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat and lace; what are they?Men.Mere men.#Dignity, and even holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine.#MrBumble had married #MrsCorney, and was master of the workhouse. Another beadle had come into power.On him the cocked hat, gold-laced coat, and staff, had all three descended.'And to-morrow two months it was done!' said #MrB, with a sigh.'It seems a age.'#MrBumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh -- there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.'I sold myself,' said #MrB, pursuing the same train of relection,'for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money.I went very reasonable.#Cheap, dirt cheap!''Cheap!' cried a shrill voice in #MrB's ear:'you would have been dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, #Lord above knows that!'#MrBumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort, who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.'#MrsBumble, ma'am!' said #MrB, with a sentimental sternness.'Well!' cried the lady.'Have the goodness to look at me,' said #MrB, fixing his eyes upon her.(If she stands such a eye as that,' said #MrB to himself,'she can stand anything.It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers.If it fails with her, my power is gone.')Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or whether the late #MrsCorney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are matters of opinion.The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by #MrB's scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.On hearing this most unexpected sound, #MrB looked, first incredulous, and afterwards amazed.He then relapsed into his former state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner.'Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?' inquired #MrsBumble.'I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma'am,' rejoined #MrB;'and although I was _not_ snoring, I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my prerogative.''_Your_ prerogative!' sneered #MrsBumble, with ineffable contempt.'I said the word, ma'am,' said #MrB.'The prerogative of a man is to command.''And what's the prerogative of a woman, in the name of #Goodness?' cried the relict of #MrC deceased.'To obey, ma'am,' thundered #MrB.'Your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive now.I wish he was, poor man!'#MrsBumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with a loud scream that #MrB was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears.But, tears were not the things to find their way to #MrB's soul; his heart was waterproof.Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased and exalted him.He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry her hardest:the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly conducive to health.'It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and softens down the temper,' said #MrB.'So cry away.'As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, #MrB took his hat from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner, thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance.Now, #MrsCorney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as #MrB was not long in discovering.The first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room.This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the other.This done, she created a little variety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated for the purpose:and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if he dared.'Get up!' said #MrsBumble, in a voice of command.'And take yourself away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.'#MrBumble rose with a very rueful countenance:wondering much what something desperate might be.Picking up his hat, he looked towards the door.'Are you going?' demanded #MrsBumble.'Certainly, my dear, certainly,' rejoined #MrB, making a quicker motion towards the door.'I did n't intend to -- I'm going, my dear!You are so very violent, that really I --'At this instant, #MrsBumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle.#MrBumble immediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence:leaving the late #MrsCorney in full possession of the field.#MrBumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten.He had a decided propensity for bullying:derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is needless to say) a coward.This is by no means a disparagement to his character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities.The remark is made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office.But, the measure of his degradation was not yet full.After making a tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much; #MrB came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen:when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.'Hem!' said #MrB, summoning up all his native dignity.'These women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. #Hallo! hallo there!What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?'With these words, #MrB opened the door, and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner:which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife.'My dear,' said #MrB,'I did n't know you were here.''Did n't know I was here!' repeated #MrsBumble.'What do _you_ do here?''I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly, my dear,' replied #Mr. Bumble:glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse-master's humility.'_You_ thought they were talking too much?' said #MrsBumble.'What business is it of yours?''Why, my dear --' urged #MrB submissively.'What business is it of yours?' demanded #MrsBumble, again.'It's very true, you're matron here, my dear,' submitted #MrB;'but I thought you might n't be in the way just then.''I'll tell you what, #MrB,' returned his lady.'We do n't want any of your interference.You're a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that do n't concern you, making everybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day.Be off; come!'#MrBumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated for an instant.#MrsBumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person.What could #MrB do?He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away; and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight.It wanted but this.He was degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery.'All in two months!' said #MrB, filled with dismal thoughts.'Two months!No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but everybody else's, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and now! --'It was too much.#MrBumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and walked, distractedly, into the street.He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty.He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary customer.It began to rain, heavily, at the moment.This determined him.#MrBumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street.The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large cloak.He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to have travelled some distance.He eyed #Bumble askance, as he entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation.#MrBumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar:so he drank his gin-and-water in silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall into company under such circumstances:that #MrB felt, every now and then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a look at the stranger:and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him.#MrBumble's awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger's eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.When they had encountered each other's glance several times in this way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.'Were you looking for me,' he said,'when you peered in at the window?''Not that I am aware of, unless you're #Mr. --'Here #MrB stopped short; for he was curious to know the stranger's name, and thought in his impatience, he might supply the blank.'I see you were not,' said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth;'or you have known my name.You do n't know it.I would recommend you not to ask for it.''I meant no harm, young man,' observed #MrB, majestically.'And have done none,' said the stranger.Another silence succeeded this short dialogue:which was again broken by the stranger.'I have seen you before, I think?' said he.'You were differently dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should know you again.You were beadle here, once; were you not?''I was,' said #MrB, in some surprise;'porochial beadle.''Just so,' rejoined the other, nodding his head.'It was in that character I saw you.What are you now?''Master of the workhouse,' rejoined #MrB, slowly and impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume.'Master of the workhouse, young man!''You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt not?' resumed the stranger, looking keenly into #MrB's eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question.'Do n't scruple to answer freely, man.I know you pretty well, you see.''I suppose, a married man,' replied #MrB, shading his eyes with his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident perplexity,'is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can, than a single one.#Porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner.'The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had not mistaken his man; then rang the bell.'Fill this glass again,' he said, handing #MrB's empty tumbler to the landlord.'Let it be strong and hot.You like it so, I suppose?''Not too strong,' replied #MrB, with a delicate cough.'You understand what that means, landlord!' said the stranger, drily.The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into #MrB's eyes.'Now listen to me,' said the stranger, after closing the door and window.'I came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you were uppermost in my mind.I want some information from you.I do n't ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is.Put up that, to begin with.'As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without.When #MrB had scrupulously examined the coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:'Carry your memory back -- let me see -- twelve years, last winter.''It's a long time,' said #MrB.'Very good.I've done it.''The scene, the workhouse.''Good!''And the time, night.''Yes.''And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves -- gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and hid their shame, rot'em in the grave!''The lying-in room, I suppose?' said #MrB, not quite following the stranger's excited description.'Yes,' said the stranger.'A boy was born there.''A many boys,' observed #MrB, shaking his head, despondingly.'A murrain on the young devils!' cried the stranger;'I speak of one; a meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a coffin-maker -- I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in it -- and who afterwards ran away to #London, as it was supposed.'Why, you mean #Oliver!#Young #Twist!' said #MrB;'I remember him, of course.There was n't a obstinater young rascal --''It's not of him I want to hear; I've heard enough of him,' said the stranger, stopping #MrB in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor #Oliver's vices.'It's of a woman; the hag that nursed his mother.Where is she?''Where is she?' said #MrB, whom the gin-and-water had rendered facetious.'It would be hard to tell.There's no midwifery there, whichever place she's gone to; so I suppose she's out of employment, anyway.''What do you mean?' demanded the stranger, sternly.'That she died last winter,' rejoined #MrB.The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in thought.For some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed more freely; and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great matter. With that he rose, as if to depart.But #MrB was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half.He well remembered the night of old #Sally's death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to #MrsCorney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman's attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of #OliverTwist. #Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger, with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason to believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry.'How can I find her?' said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused afresh by the intelligence.'Only through me,' rejoined #MrB.'When?' cried the stranger, hastily.'To-morrow,' rejoined #Bumble.'At nine in the evening,' said the stranger, producing a scrap of paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side, in characters that betrayed his agitation;'at nine in the evening, bring her to me there.I need n't tell you to be secret.It's your interest.'With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk.Shortly remarking that their roads were different, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night.On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name.The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him to ask it.'What do you want?' cried the man, turning quickly round, as #Bumble touched him on the arm.'Following me?''Only to ask a question,' said the other, pointing to the scrap of paper.'What name am I to ask for?''Monks!' rejoined the man; and strode hastily, away.CHAPTER #XXXVIIICONTAINING AN #ACCOUNTOF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN #MRA MRS. BUMBLE, AND #MRM, #AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEWIt was a dull, close, overcast summer evening.The clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder-storm, when #Mr. and #MrsBumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river.They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain, and sheltering them from observation.The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though -- the way being dirty -- to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints.They went on, in profound silence; every now and then, #MrB relaxed his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of destination.This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime.It was a collection of mere hovels:some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the river's bank.A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it:and here and there an oar or coil of rope:appeared, at first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view to their being actually employed.In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind.It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements.But it had long since gone to ruin.The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving itself in the same fate.It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down.'The place should be somewhere here,' said #Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand.'Halloa there!' cried a voice from above.Following the sound, #MrB raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.'Stand still, a minute,' cried the voice;'I'll be with you directly.' With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.'Is that the man?' asked #MrB's good lady.#MrBumble nodded in the affirmative.'Then, mind what I told you,' said the matron:'and be careful to say as little as you can, or you'll betray us at once.'#MrBumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was prevented by the appearance of #Monks: who opened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them inwards.'Come in!' he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground.'Do n't keep me here!'The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any other invitation.#MrBumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed:obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.'What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?' said #Monks, turning round, and addressing #Bumble, after he had bolted the door behind them.'We -- we were only cooling ourselves,' stammered #Bumble, looking apprehensively about him.'Cooling yourselves!' retorted #Monks.'Not all the rain that ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell's fire out, as a man can carry about with him.You wo n't cool yourself so easily; do n't think it!'With this agreeable speech, #Monks turned short upon the matron, and bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.'This is the woman, is it?' demanded #Monks.'Hem!That is the woman,' replied #MrB, mindful of his wife's caution.'You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?' said the matron, interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of #Monks.'I know they will always keep _one_ till it's found out,' said #Monks.'And what may that be?' asked the matron.'The loss of their own good name,' replied #Monks.'So, by the same rule, if a woman's a party to a secret that might hang or transport her, I'm not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I!Do you understand, mistress?''No,' rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.'Of course you do n't!' said #Monks.'How should you?'Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof.He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder, leading to another floor of warehouses above:when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the crazy building to its centre.'Hear it!' he cried, shrinking back.'Hear it!Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it.I hate the sound!'He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of #MrB, that it was much distorted and discoloured.'These fits come over me, now and then,' said #Monks, observing his alarm;'and thunder sometimes brings them on. Do n't mind me now; it's all over for this once.'Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling:and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it.'Now,' said #Monks, when they had all three seated themselves,'the sooner we come to our business, the better for all.The woman know what it is, does she?'The question was addressed to #Bumble; but his wife anticipated the reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.'He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died; and that she told you something --''About the mother of the boy you named,' replied the matron interrupting him.'Yes.''The first question is, of what nature was her communication?' said #Monks.'That's the second,' observed the woman with much deliberation.'The first is, what may the communication be worth?''Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?' asked #Monks.'Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,' answered #MrsBumble: who did not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.'Humph!' said #Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry;'there may be money's worth to get, eh?''Perhaps there may,' was the composed reply.'Something that was taken from her,' said #Monks.'Something that she wore.Something that --''You had better bid,' interrupted #MrsBumble.'I have heard enough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.'#MrBumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes:which he directed towards his wife and #Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded, what sum was required for the disclosure.'What's it worth to you?' asked the woman, as collectedly as before.'It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,' replied #Monks.'Speak out, and let me know which.''Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold,' said the woman;'and I'll tell you all I know.Not before.''Five-and-twenty pounds!' exclaimed #Monks, drawing back.'I spoke as plainly as I could,' replied #MrsBumble.'It's not a large sum, either.''Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it's told!' cried #Monks impatiently;'and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more!''Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in course of time,' answered the matron, still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed.'As to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!''What if I pay it for nothing?' asked #Monks, hesitating.'You can easily take it away again,' replied the matron.'I am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected.''Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,' submitted #MrB, in a voice tremulous with fear:'_I_ am here, my dear. And besides,' said #MrB, his teeth chattering as he spoke,'Mr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons.#MrMonks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a little run to seed, as I may say; bu he has heerd:I say I have no doubt #MrM has heerd, my dear:that I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon strength, if I'm once roused.I only want a little rousing; that's all.'As #MrB spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression of every feature, that he _did_ want a little rousing, and not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for the purpose.'You are a fool,' said #MrsBumble, in reply;'and had better hold your tongue.''He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he ca n't speak in a lower tone,' said #Monks, grimly.'So!He's your husband, eh?''He my husband!' tittered the matron, parrying the question.'I thought as much, when you came in,' rejoined #Monks, marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke.'So much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I find that there's only one will between them.I'm in earnest. #See here!'He thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the woman.'Now,' he said,'gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let's hear your story.'The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, #Monks, raising his face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say.The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible.The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme.'When this woman, that we called old #Sally, died,' the matron began,'she and I were alone.''Was there no one by?' asked #Monks, in the same hollow whisper;'No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed?No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?''Not a soul,' replied the woman;'we were alone.#_I_ stood alone beside the body when death came over it.''Good,' said #Monks, regarding her attentively.'Go on.''She spoke of a young creature,' resumed the matron,'who had brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room, but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.''Ay?' said #Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder,'Blood!How things come about!''The child was the one you named to him last night,' said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband;'the mother this nurse had robbed.''In life?' asked #Monks.'In death,' replied the woman, with something like a shudder.'She stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant's sake.''She sold it,' cried #Monks, with desperate eagerness;'did she sell it? Where?When?To whom?How long before?''As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,' said the matron,'she fell back and died.''Without saying more?' cried #Monks, in a voice which, from its very suppression, seemed only the more furious.'It's a lie! I'll not be played with.She said more.I'll tear the life out of you both, but I'll know what it was.''She did n't utter another word,' said the woman, to all appearance unmoved (as #MrB was very far from being) by the strange man's violence;'but she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.''Which contained --' interposed #Monks, stretching forward.'Nothing,' replied the woman;'it was a pawnbroker's duplicate.''For what?' demanded #Monks.'In good time I'll tell you.' said the woman.'I judge that she had kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker's interest year by year, and prevent its running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed.#Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand.The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.''Where is it now?' asked #Monks quickly.'_There_,' replied the woman.And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a #French watch, which #Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands.It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring.'It has the word ``Agnes'' engraved on the inside,' said the woman.'There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born.I found out that.''And this is all?' said #Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet.'All,' replied the woman.#MrBumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue.'I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,' said his wife addressing #Monks, after a short silence;'and I want to know nothing; for it's safer not.But I may ask you two questions, may I?''You may ask,' said #Monks, with some show of surprise;'but whether I answer or not is another question.'' -- #Which makes three,' observed #MrB, essaying a stroke of facetiousness.'Is that what you expected to get from me?' demanded the matron.'It is,' replied #Monks.'The other question?''What do you propose to do with it?Can it be used against me?''Never,' rejoined #Monks;'nor against me either.See here!But do n't move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.'With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened close at #MrB's feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward, with great precipitation.'Look down,' said #Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf.'Do n't fear me.I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.'Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even #MrB himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles.There had once been a water-mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course.'If you flung a man's body down there, where would it be to-morrow morning?' said #Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.'Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,' replied #Bumble, recoiling at the thought.#Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone.The three looking into each other's faces, seemed to breathe more freely.'There!' said #Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back into its former position.'If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it.We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.''By all means,' observed #MrB, with great alacrity.'You'll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?' said #Monks, with a threatening look.'I am not afraid of your wife.''You may depend upon me, young man,' answered #MrB, bowing himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness.'On everybody's account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. #Monks.''I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,' remarked #Monks.'Light your lantern!And get away from here as fast as you can.'It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or #MrB, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below.He lighted his lantern from that which #Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his wife.#Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the rushing of the water.They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for #Monks started at every shadow; and #MrB, holding his lantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure:looking nervously about him for hidden trap-doors.The gate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened by #Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside.They were no sooner gone, than #Monks, who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he returned to the chamber he had just quitted.CHAPTER #XXXIXINTRODUCES SOME #RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE #READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND #SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE #JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHEROn the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated, #MrW, awakening from a nap, drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.The room in which #MrS propounded this question, was not one of those he had tenanted, previous to the #Chertsey expedition, although it was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings.It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation as his old quarters:being a mean and badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty lane.Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman's having gone down in the world of late:for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of #MrS himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat, by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week's growth.The dog sat at the bedside:now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention. Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber's ordinary dress, was a female:so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to #MrS's question.'Not long gone seven,' said the girl.'How do you feel to-night, #Bill?''As weak as water,' replied #MrS, with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs.'Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow.'#Illness had not improved #MrS's temper; for, as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her awkwardness, and struck her.'Whining are you?' said #Sikes.'Come!Do n't stand snivelling there. If you ca n't do anything better than that, cut off altogether.D'ye hear me?''I hear you,' replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a laugh.'What fancy have you got in your head now?''Oh! you've thought better of it, have you?' growled #Sikes, marking the tear which trembled in her eye.'All the better for you, you have.''Why, you do n't mean to say, you'd be hard upon me to-night, #Bill,' said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.'No!' cried #MrS.'Why not?''Such a number of nights,' said the girl, with a touch of woman's tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even to her voice:'such a number of nights as I've been patient with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that I've seen you like yourself; you would n't have served me as you did just now, if you'd thought of that, would you?#Come, come; say you would n't.''Well, then,' rejoined #MrS,'I would n't.Why, damme, now, the girls's whining again!''It's nothing,' said the girl, throwing herself into a chair.'Do n't you seem to mind me.It'll soon be over.''What'll be over?' demanded #MrS in a savage voice.'What foolery are you up to, now, again?Get up and bustle about, and do n't come over me with your woman's nonsense.'At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and fainted, before #MrS could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his threats.Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon emergency; for #MissNancy's hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance; #MrS tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual, called for assistance.'What's the matter here, my dear?' said #Fagin, looking in.'Lend a hand to the girl, ca n't you?' replied #Sikes impatiently.'Do n't stand chattering and grinning at me!'With an exclamation of surprise, #Fagin hastened to the girl's assistance, while #MrJ (otherwise the #ArtfulDodger), who had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of #MasterCharlesBates who came close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient's throat:previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes.'Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, #Charley,' said #MrD;'and you slap her hands, #Fagin, while #Bill undoes the petticuts.'These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that department consigned to #MasterBates, who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry:were not long in producing the desired effect.The girl gradually recovered her senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow:leaving #MrS to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance.'Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?' he asked #Fagin.'No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and I've brought something good with me, that you'll be glad to see. #Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give #Bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on, this morning.'In compliance with #MrF's request, the #Artful untied this bundle, which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed the articles it contained, one by one, to #CharleyBates: who placed them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence.'Sitch a rabbit pie, #Bill,' exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing to view a huge pasty;'sitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender limbs, #Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there's no occasion to pick'em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it'll go nigh to blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers did n't work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness, -- oh no!Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of double Glo'ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever lushed!'Uttering this last panegyric, #MasterBates produced, from one of his extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while #MrD, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried:which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moment's hesitation.'Ah!' said #Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction.'You'll do, #Bill; you'll do now.''Do!' exclaimed #MrS;'I might have been done for, twenty times over, afore you'd have done anything to help me.What do you mean by leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted wagabond?''Only hear him, boys!' said #Fagin, shrugging his shoulders.'And us come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.''The things is well enough in their way,' observed #Mr. Sikes:a little soothed as he glanced over the table;'but what have you got to say for yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health, blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal time, than if I was that'ere dog. -- Drive him down, #Charley!''I never see such a jolly dog as that,' cried #MasterBates, doing as he was desired.'Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market! He'd make his fortun' on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drayma besides.''Hold your din,' cried #Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still growling angrily.'What have you got to say for yourself, you withered old fence, eh?''I was away from #London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,' replied the Jew.'And what about the other fortnight?' demanded #Sikes.'What about the other fortnight that you've left me lying here, like a sick rat in his hole?''I could n't help it, #Bill.I ca n't go into a long explanation before company; but I could n't help it, upon my honour.''Upon your what?' growled #Sikes, with excessive disgust.'Here! Cut me off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my mouth, or it'll choke me dead.''Do n't be out of temper, my dear,' urged #Fagin, submissively.'I have never forgot you, #Bill; never once.''No!I'll pound it that you ha n't,' replied #Sikes, with a bitter grin.'You've been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid shivering and burning here; and #Bill was to do this; and #Bill was to do that; and #Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well: and was quite poor enough for your work. If it had n't been for the girl, I might have died.''There now, #Bill,' remonstrated #Fagin, eagerly catching at the word.'If it had n't been for the girl!Who but poor ould #Fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you?''He says true enough there!' said #Nancy, coming hastily forward.'Let him be; let him be.'#Nancy's appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys, receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while #Fagin, assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought #MrS into a better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he condescended to make.'It's all very well,' said #MrS;'but I must have some blunt from you to-night.''I have n't a piece of coin about me,' replied the Jew.'Then you've got lots at home,' retorted #Sikes;'and I must have some from there.''Lots!' cried #Fagin, holding up is hands.'I have n't so much as would --''I do n't know how much you've got, and I dare say you hardly know yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,' said #Sikes;'but I must have some to-night; and that's flat.''Well, well,' said #Fagin, with a sigh,'I'll send the #Artful round presently.''You wo n't do nothing of the kind,' rejoined #MrS.'The #Artful's a deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you put him up to it.#Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all sure; and I'll lie down and have a snooze while she's gone.'After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, #Fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; #MrS sullenly remarking that if he could n't get any more he must accompany him home; with the #Dodger and #MasterBates put the eatables in the cupboard.The Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by #Nancy and the boys:#MrSikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady's return.In due course, they arrived at #Fagin's abode, where they found #TobyCrackit and #MrC intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage, which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his young friends.#MrC, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after #Sikes, took up his hat to go.'Has nobody been, #Toby?' asked #Fagin.'Not a living leg,' answered #MrC, pulling up his collar;'it's been as dull as swipes.You ought to stand something handsome, #Fagin, to recompense me for keeping house so long. #Damme, I'm as flat as a juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as #Newgate, if I had n't had the good natur' to amuse this youngster.#Horrid dull, I'm blessed if I a n't!'With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, #MrT swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that #MrC, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he did n't value his losses the snap of his little finger.'Wot a rum chap you are, #Tom!' said #MasterBates, highly amused by this declaration.'Not a bit of it,' replied #MrC.'Am I, #Fagin?''A very clever fellow, my dear,' said #Fagin, patting him on the shoulder, and winking to his other pupils.'And #MrC is a heavy swell; a n't he, #Fagin?' asked #Tom.'No doubt at all of that, my dear.''And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; a n't it, #Fagin?' pursued #Tom.'Very much so, indeed, my dear.They're only jealous, #Tom, because he wo n't give it to them.''Ah!' cried #Tom, triumphantly,'that's where it is!He has cleaned me out.But I can go and earn some more, when I like; ca n't I, #Fagin?''To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, #Tom; so make up your loss at once, and do n't lose any more time.#Dodger! #Charley! It's time you were on the lay.Come!It's near ten, and nothing done yet.'In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to #Nancy, took up their hats, and left the room; the #Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging, as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of #MrC; in whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar:inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than #MrC for being seen in good society:and a great number of fine gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash #TobyCrackit.'Now,' said #Fagin, when they had left the room,'I'll go and get you that cash, #Nancy.This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear.I never lock up my money, for I've got none to lock up, my dear -- ha! ha! ha! -- none to lock up. It's a poor trade, #Nancy, and no thanks; but I'm fond of seeing the young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all.#Hush!' he said, hastily concealing the key in his breast;'who's that?#Listen!'The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person, whoever he was, came or went:until the murmur of a man's voice reached her ears.The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table. The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the heat:in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action:which, however, had been unobserved by #Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time.'Bah!' he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption;'it's the man I expected before; he's coming downstairs.Not a word about the money while he's here, #Nance.He wo n't stop long.Not ten minutes, my dear.'Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to the door, as a man's step was heard upon the stairs without.He reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her.It was #Monks.'Only one of my young people,' said #Fagin, observing that #Monks drew back, on beholding a stranger.'Do n't move, #Nancy.'The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at #Monks with an air of careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards #Fagin, she stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.'Any news?' inquired #Fagin.'Great.''And -- and -- good?' asked #Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine.'Not bad, any way,' replied #Monks with a smile.'I have been prompt enough this time.Let me have a word with you.'The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room, although she could see that #Monks was pointing to her.The Jew: perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he endeavoured to get rid of her:pointed upward, and took #Monks out of the room.'Not that infernal hole we were in before,' she could hear the man say as they went upstairs.#Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to the second story.Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door, listening with breathless interest.The moment the noise ceased, she glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence; and was lost in the gloom above.The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards, the two men were heard descending.#Monks went at once into the street; and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money.When he returned, the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone.'Why, #Nance!' exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle,'how pale you are!''Pale!' echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look steadily at him.'Quite horrible.What have you been doing to yourself?''Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I do n't know how long and all,' replied the girl carelessly.'Come!Let me get back; that's a dear.'With a sigh for every piece of money, #Fagin told the amount into her hand.They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a'good-night.'When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep; and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way.Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that in which #Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run.After completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath:and, as if suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears.It might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts:soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker.If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to #MrS, he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted.It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment.That she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have taken the alarm at once; but #MrS lacking the niceties of discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions.As that day closed in, the girl's excitement increased; and, when night came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.#Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass towards #Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when these symptoms first struck him.'Why, burn my body!' said the man, raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face.'You look like a corpse come to life again.What's the matter?''Matter!' replied the girl.'Nothing.What do you look at me so hard for?''What foolery is this?' demanded #Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and shaking her roughly.'What is it?What do you mean?What are you thinking of?''Of many things, #Bill,' replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so, pressing her hands upon her eyes.'But, #Lord!What odds in that?'The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them.'I tell you wot it is,' said #Sikes;'if you have n't caught the fever, and got it comin' on, now, there's something more than usual in the wind, and something dangerous too.You're not a-going to --.No, damme! you would n't do that!''Do what?' asked the girl.'There ai n't,' said #Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the words to himself;'there ai n't a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I'd have cut her throat three months ago.She's got the fever coming on; that's it.'Fortifying himself with this assurance, #Sikes drained the glass to the bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank off the contents.'Now,' said the robber,'come and sit aside of me, and put on your own face; or I'll alter it so, that you wo n't know it agin when you do want it.'The girl obeyed.Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the pillow: turning his eyes upon her face.They closed; opened again; closed once more; again opened.He shifted his position restlessly; and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of rising, into a deep and heavy sleep.The grasp of his hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a profound trance.'The laudanum has taken effect at last,' murmured the girl, as she rose from the bedside.'I may be too late, even now.'She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl:looking fearfully round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she expected every moment to feel the pressure of #Sikes's heavy hand upon her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber's lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch, hurried from the house.A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.'Has it long gone the half-hour?' asked the girl.'It'll strike the hour in another quarter,' said the man: raising his lantern to her face.'And I can not get there in less than an hour or more,' muttered #Nancy: brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way, in making from #Spitalfields towards the West-End of #London.The clock struck ten, increasing her impatience.She tore along the narrow pavement:elbowing the passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses' heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like.'The woman is mad!' said the people, turning to look after her as she rushed away.When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past.Some quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back, surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she neared her place of destination, she was alone.It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near #HydePark. As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her to the spot, the clock struck eleven.She had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound determined her, and she stepped into the hall.The porter's seat was vacant.She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards the stairs.'Now, young woman!' said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a door behind her,'who do you want here?''A lady who is stopping in this house,' answered the girl.'A lady!' was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look.'What lady?''Miss Maylie,' said #Nancy.The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her. To him, #Nancy repeated her request.'What name am I to say?' asked the waiter.'It's of no use saying any,' replied #Nancy.'Nor business?' said the man.'No, nor that neither,' rejoined the girl.'I must see the lady.''Come!' said the man, pushing her towards the door.'None of this. #Take yourself off.''I shall be carried out if I go!' said the girl violently;'and I can make that a job that two of you wo n't like to do.Is n't there anybody here,' she said, looking round,'that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me?'This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward to interfere.'Take it up for her, #Joe; ca n't you?' said this person.'What's the good?' replied the man.'You do n't suppose the young lady will see such as her; do you?'This allusion to #Nancy's doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.'Do what you like with me,' said the girl, turning to the men again;'but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for #GodAlmighty's sake.'The soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.'What's it to be?' said the man, with one foot on the stairs.'That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to #MissMaylie alone,' said #Nancy;'and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor.''I say,' said the man,'you're coming it strong!''You give the message,' said the girl firmly;'and let me hear the answer.'The man ran upstairs.#Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless, listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk upstairs.'It's no good being proper in this world,' said the first housemaid.'Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,' said the second.The third contented herself with wondering'what ladies was made of'; and the fourth took the first in a quartette of'Shameful!' with which the #Dianas concluded.Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: #Nancy followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left her, and retired.CHAPTER XLA #STRANGE INTERVIEW, #WHICH IS A #SEQUEL TO THE #LAST CHAMBERThe girl's life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of #London, but there was something of the woman's original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered, and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame, and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview.But struggling with these better feelings was pride, -- the vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and self-assured.The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself, -- even this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness, but which alone connected her with that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so many, many traces when a very child.She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said:'It's a hard matter to get to see you, lady.If I had taken offence, and gone away, as many would have done, you'd have been sorry for it one day, and not without reason either.''I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,' replied #Rose.'Do not think of that.#Tell me why you wished to see me. I am the person you inquired for.'The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl completely by surprise, and she burst into tears.'Oh, lady, lady!' she said, clasping her hands passionately before her face,'if there was more like you, there would be fewer like me, -- there would -- there would!''Sit down,' said #Rose, earnestly.'If you are in poverty or affliction I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can, -- I shall indeed.#Sit down.''Let me stand, lady,' said the girl, still weeping,'and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better.It is growing late. Is -- is -- that door shut?''Yes,' said #Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it.'Why?''Because,' said the girl,'I am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands.I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to old #Fagin's on the night he went out from the house in #Pentonville.''You!' said #RoseMaylie.'I, lady!' replied the girl.'I am the infamous creature you have heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on #London streets have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me God!Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady.I am younger than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.''What dreadful things are these!' said #Rose, involuntarily falling from her strange companion.'Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,' cried the girl,'that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness, and -- and -- something worse than all -- as I have been from my cradle.I may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be my deathbed.''I pity you!' said #Rose, in a broken voice.'It wrings my heart to hear you!''Heaven bless you for your goodness!' rejoined the girl.'If you knew what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to tell you what I have overheard.Do you know a man named #Monks?''No,' said #Rose.'He knows you,' replied the girl;'and knew you were here, for it was by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.''I never heard the name,' said #Rose.'Then he goes by some other amongst us,' rejoined the girl,'which I more than thought before.Some time ago, and soon after #Oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery, I -- suspecting this man -- listened to a conversation held between him and #Fagin in the dark. I found out, from what I heard, that #Monks -- the man I asked you about, you know --''Yes,' said #Rose,'I understand.'' -- That #Monks,' pursued the girl,'had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for, though I could n't make out why.A bargain was struck with #Fagin, that if #Oliver was got back he should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.''For what purpose?' asked #Rose.'He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of finding out,' said the girl;'and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery.But I did; and I saw him no more till last night.''And what occurred then?''I'll tell you, lady.Last night he came again.Again they went upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me, again listened at the door.The first words I heard #Monks say were these:``So the only proofs of the boy's identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin.''They laughed, and talked of his success in doing this; and #Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild, said that though he had got the young devil's money safely now, he'd rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the father's will, by driving him through every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital felony which #Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit of him besides.''What is all this!' said #Rose.'The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,' replied the girl.'Then, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy's life without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he could n't, he'd be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he took advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet. ``In short, #Fagin,'' he says, ``Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as I'll contrive for my young brother, #Oliver.''''His brother!' exclaimed #Rose.'Those were his words,' said #Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of #Sikes haunted her perpetually.'And more. When he spoke of you and the other lady, and said it seemed contrived by #Heaven, or the devil, against him, that #Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who your two-legged spaniel was.''You do not mean,' said #Rose, turning very pale,'to tell me that this was said in earnest?''He spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,' replied the girl, shaking her head.'He is an earnest man when his hatred is up. I know many who do worse things; but I'd rather listen to them all a dozen times, than to that Monks once.It is growing late, and I have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this.I must get back quickly.''But what can I do?' said #Rose.'To what use can I turn this communication without you?#Back!Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors?If you repeat this information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hour's delay.''I wish to go back,' said the girl.'I must go back, because -- how can I tell such things to an innocent lady like you? -- because among the men I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all; that I ca n't leave:no, not even to be saved from the life I am leading now.''Your having interfered in this dear boy's behalf before,' said #Rose;'your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard; your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed.Oh!' said the earnest girl, folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face,'do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex; the first -- the first, I do believe, who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion.Do hear my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.''Lady,' cried the girl, sinking on her knees,'dear, sweet, angel lady, you _are_ the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!''It is never too late,' said #Rose,'for penitence and atonement.''It is,' cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind;'I can not leave him now!I could not be his death.''Why should you be?' asked #Rose.'Nothing could save him,' cried the girl.'If I told others what I have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. He is the boldest, and has been so cruel!''Is it possible,' cried #Rose,'that for such a man as this, you can resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue?It is madness.''I do n't know what it is,' answered the girl;'I only know that it is so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself.I must go back.Whether it is #God's wrath for the wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew that I was to die by his hand at last.''What am I to do?' said #Rose.'I should not let you depart from me thus.''You should, lady, and I know you will,' rejoined the girl, rising.'You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness, and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.''Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?' said #Rose.'This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me, benefit #Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?''You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret, and advise you what to do,' rejoined the girl.'But where can I find you again when it is necessary?' asked #Rose.'I do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?''Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not be watched or followed?' asked the girl.'I promise you solemnly,' answered #Rose.'Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,' said the girl without hesitation,'I will walk on #London Bridge if I am alive.''Stay another moment,' interposed #Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door.'Think once again on your own condition, and the opportunity you have of escaping from it.You have a claim on me:not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption.Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this man, when a word can save you?What fascination is it that can take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery?Oh! is there no chord in your heart that I can touch!Is there nothing left, to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!''When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,' replied the girl steadily,'give away your hearts, love will carry you all lengths -- even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers, everything, to fill them.When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us?Pity us, lady -- pity us for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a comfort and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.''You will,' said #Rose, after a pause,'take some money from me, which may enable you to live without dishonesty -- at all events until we meet again?''Not a penny,' replied the girl, waving her hand.'Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,' said #Rose, stepping gently forward.'I wish to serve you indeed.''You would serve me best, lady,' replied the girl, wringing her hands,'if you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be something not to die in the hell in which I have lived.God bless you, sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine!'Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away; while #RoseMaylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank into a chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts.CHAPTER #XLI#CONTAINING #FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND #SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, #LIKE MISFORTUNES, #SELDOM COME ALONEHer situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which #Oliver's history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl.Her words and manner had touched #RoseMaylie's heart; and, mingled with her love for her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.They purposed remaining in #London only three days, prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast.It was now midnight of the first day.What course of action could she determine upon, which could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion?#MrLosberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but #Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman's impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of #Oliver's recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her representations in the girl's behalf could be seconded by no experienced person.These were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to #MrsMaylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject.As to resorting to any legal adviser, even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of, for the same reason.Once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from #Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when -- the tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection -- he might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.#Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind; #Rose passed a sleepless and anxious night.After more communing with herself next day, she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting #Harry.'If it be painful to him,' she thought,'to come back here, how painful it will be to me!But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me -- he did when he went away.I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.'And here #Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word, when #Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with #MrG for a body-guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm.'What makes you look so flurried?' asked #Rose, advancing to meet him.'I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,' replied the boy.'Oh dear!To think that I should see him at last, and you should be able to know that I have told you the truth!''I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,' said #Rose, soothing him.'But what is this? -- of whom do you speak?''I have seen the gentleman,' replied #Oliver, scarcely able to articulate,'the gentleman who was so good to me -- #MrB, that we have so often talked about.''Where?' asked #Rose.'Getting out of a coach,' replied #Oliver, shedding tears of delight,'and going into a house.I did n't speak to him -- I could n't speak to him, for he did n't see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up to him.But #Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said he did.#Look here,' said #Oliver, opening a scrap of paper,'here it is; here's where he lives -- I'm going there directly!Oh, dear me, dear me!What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!'With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy, #Rose read the address, which was #CravenStreet, in the #Strand.She very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account.'Quick!' she said.'Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to go with me.I will take you there directly, without a minute's loss of time.I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and be ready as soon as you are.'#Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to #CravenStreet.When they arrived there, #Rose left #Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant, requested to see #MrB on very pressing business.The servant soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an upper room, #MissMaylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat.At no great distance from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin propped thereupon.'Dear me,' said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising with great politeness,'I beg your pardon, young lady -- I imagined it was some importunate person who -- I beg you will excuse me.Be seated, pray.''Mr. #Brownlow, I believe, sir?' said #Rose, glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken.'That is my name,' said the old gentleman.'This is my friend, #MrG.#Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?''I believe,' interposed #MissMaylie,'that at this period of our interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to speak to you.'#MrBrownlow inclined his head.#MrG, who had made one very stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and dropped into it again.'I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,' said #Rose, naturally embarrassed;'but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again.''Indeed!' said #MrB.'Oliver Twist you knew him as,' replied #Rose.The words no sooner escaped her lips, than #MrG, who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.#MrBrowlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner.He drew his chair nearer to #MissMaylie's, and said,'Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced to entertain of that poor child, in #Heaven's name put me in possession of it.''A bad one!I'll eat my head if he is not a bad one,' growled #MrG, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle of his face.'He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,' said #Rose, colouring;'and that #Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.''I'm only sixty-one,' said #MrG, with the same rigid face.'And, as the devil's in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I do n't see the application of that remark.''Do not heed my friend, #MissMaylie,' said #MrB;'he does not mean what he says.''Yes, he does,' growled #MrG.'No, he does not,' said #MrB, obviously rising in wrath as he spoke.'He'll eat his head, if he does n't,' growled #MrG.'He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,' said #MrB.'And he'd uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,' responded #MrG, knocking his stick upon the floor.Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.'Now, #MissMaylie,' said #MrB,'to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested.Will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child:allowing me to promise that I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me, has been considerably shaken.'#Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a few natural words, all that had befallen #Oliver since he left #MrB's house; reserving #Nancy's information for that gentleman's private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow, for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend.'Thank God!' said the old gentleman.'This is great happiness to me, great happiness.But you have not told me where he is now, #MissMaylie.You must pardon my finding fault with you, -- but why not have brought him?''He is waiting in a coach at the door,' replied #Rose.'At this door!' cried the old gentleman.With which he hurried out of the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach, without another word.When the room-door closed behind him, #MrG lifted up his head, and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot, described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table; sitting in it all the time.After performing this evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before #Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface.'Hush!' he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding.'Do n't be afraid.I'm old enough to be your grandfather. You're a sweet girl.I like you.Here they are!'In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat, #MrB returned, accompanied by #Oliver, whom #MrG received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in #Oliver's behalf, #RoseMaylie would have been well repaid.'There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,' said #MrB, ringing the bell.'Send #MrsBedwin here, if you please.'The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders.'Why, you get blinder every day, #Bedwin,' said #MrB, rather testily.'Well, that I do, sir,' replied the old lady.'People's eyes, at my time of life, do n't improve with age, sir.''I could have told you that,' rejoined #MrB;'but put on your glasses, and see if you ca n't find out what you were wanted for, will you?'The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But #Oliver's patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.'God be good to me!' cried the old lady, embracing him;'it is my innocent boy!''My dear old nurse!' cried #Oliver.'He would come back -- I knew he would,' said the old lady, holding him in her arms.'How well he looks, and how like a gentleman's son he is dressed again!Where have you been, this long, long while?#Ah! the same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad.I have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was a lightsome young creature.'Running on thus, and now holding #Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns.Leaving her and #Oliver to compare notes at leisure, #MrB led the way into another room; and there, heard from #Rose a full narration of her interview with #Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity.#Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend #MrL in the first instance.The old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself.To afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight o'clock that evening, and that in the meantime #MrsMaylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred.These preliminaries adjusted, #Rose and #Oliver returned home.#Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor's wrath. #Nancy's history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and #Duff; and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies.And, doubtless, he would, in this first outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment's consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in part, by corresponding violence on the side of #MrB, who was himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose.'Then what the devil is to be done?' said the impetuous doctor, when they had rejoined the two ladies.'Are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to #Oliver?''Not exactly that,' rejoined #MrB, laughing;'but we must proceed gently and with great care.''Gentleness and care,' exclaimed the doctor.'I'd send them one and all to --''Never mind where,' interposed #MrB.'But reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.''What object?' asked the doctor.'Simply, the discovery of #Oliver's parentage, and regaining for him the inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently deprived.''Ah!' said #MrL, cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief;'I almost forgot that.''You see,' pursued #MrB;'placing this poor girl entirely out of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should we bring about?''Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,' suggested the doctor, #'and transporting the rest.''Very good,' replied #MrB, smiling;'but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very #Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest -- or at least to #Oliver's, which is the same thing.''How?' inquired the doctor.'Thus.It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, #Monks, upon his knees.That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people.For, suppose he were apprehended, we have no proof against him.He is not even (so far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies. If he were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.''Then,' said the doctor impetuously,'I put it to you again, whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions, but really --''Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,' said #MrB, interrupting #Rose as she was about to speak.'The promise shall be kept.I do n't think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with our proceedings.But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law; or, if she will not, or can not do that, to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us to identify him.She can not be seen until next Sunday night; this is Tuesday.I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from #Oliver himself.'Although #MrL received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and #MrsMaylie sided very strongly with #MrB, that gentleman's proposition was carried unanimously.'I should like,' he said,'to call in the aid of my friend #Grimwig.He is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted the #Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not, you must determine for yourselves.''I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in mine,' said the doctor.'We must put it to the vote,' replied #MrB,'who may he be?''That lady's son, and this young lady's -- very old friend,' said the doctor, motioning towards #MrsMaylie, and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece.#Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and #HarryMaylie and #MrG were accordingly added to the committee.'We stay in town, of course,' said #MrsMaylie,'while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success.I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that any hope remains.''Good!' rejoined #MrB.'And as I see on the faces about me, a disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to corroborate #Oliver's tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story.#Believe me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough.Come!#Supper has been announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company, and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world.'With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to #MrsMaylie, and escorted her into the supper-room.#MrLosberne followed, leading #Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.CHAPTER #XLIIAN #OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER'S, #EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS, BECOMES A #PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE #METROPOLISUpon the night when #Nancy, having lulled #MrS to sleep, hurried on her self-imposed mission to #RoseMaylie, there advanced towards #London, by the #GreatNorthRoad, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention.They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female:for the former was one of those long-limbed, knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age, -- looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys.The woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back. Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough.This circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of unusual extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head:as if reproaching her tardiness, and urging her to greater exertion.Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until they passed through #Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion,'Come on, ca n't yer?What a lazybones yer are, #Charlotte.''It's a heavy load, I can tell you,' said the female, coming up, almost breathless with fatigue.'Heavy!What are yer talking about?What are yer made for?' rejoined the male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the other shoulder.'Oh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ai n't enough to tire anybody's patience out, I do n't know what is!''Is it much farther?' asked the woman, resting herself against a bank, and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.'Much farther!Yer as good as there,' said the long-legged tramper, pointing out before him.'Look there!Those are the lights of #London.''They're a good two mile off, at least,' said the woman despondingly.'Never mind whether they're two mile off, or twenty,' said #NoahClaypole; for he it was;'but get up and come on, or I'll kick yer, and so I give yer notice.'As #Noah's red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution, the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his side.'Where do you mean to stop for the night, #Noah?' she asked, after they had walked a few hundred yards.'How should I know?' replied #Noah, whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking.'Near, I hope,' said #Charlotte.'No, not near,' replied #MrC.'There!Not near; so do n't think it.''Why not?''When I tell yer that I do n't mean to do a thing, that's enough, without any why or because either,' replied #MrC with dignity.'Well, you need n't be so cross,' said his companion.'A pretty thing it would be, would n't it to go and stop at the very first public-house outside the town, so that #Sowerberry, if he come up after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on,' said #MrC in a jeering tone.'No!I shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop till we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on.'Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I've got a head; for if we had n't gone, at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer'd have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady.And serve yer right for being a fool.''I know I ai n't as cunning as you are,' replied #Charlotte;'but do n't put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up.You would have been if I had been, any way.''Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,' said #MrC.'I took it for you, #Noah, dear,' rejoined #Charlotte.'Did I keep it?' asked #MrC.'No; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you are,' said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm through his.This was indeed the case; but as it was not #MrC's habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted #Charlotte to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be found on her:which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape.Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.In pursuance of this cautious plan, #MrC went on, without halting, until he arrived at the Angel at #Islington, where he wisely judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that #London began in earnest.Just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he crossed into #SaintJohn's Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between #Gray's #InnLane and #Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of #London.Through these streets, #NoahClaypole walked, dragging #Charlotte after him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose.At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced his intention of putting up there, for the night.'So give us the bundle,' said #Noah, unstrapping it from the woman's shoulders, and slinging it over his own;'and do n't yer speak, except when yer spoke to.What's the name of the house -- t-h-r -- three what?''Cripples,' said #Charlotte.'Three Cripples,' repeated #Noah,'and a very good sign too.Now, then! Keep close at my heels, and come along.'With these injunctions, he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house, followed by his companion.There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He stared very hard at #Noah, and #Noah stared very hard at him.If #Noah had been attired in his charity-boy's dress, there might have been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a public-house.'Is this the #ThreeCripples?' asked #Noah.'That is the dabe of this'ouse,' replied the Jew.'A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country, recommended us here,' said #Noah, nudging #Charlotte, perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise.'We want to sleep here to-night.''I'b dot certaid you cad,' said #Barney, who was the attendant sprite;'but I'll idquire.''Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring, will yer?' said #Noah.#Barney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting the required viands before them; having done which, he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable couple to their refreshment.Now, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation.The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and #Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related, when #Fagin, in the course of his evening's business, came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.'Hush!' said Barney:'stradegers id the next roob.''Strangers!' repeated the old man in a whisper.'Ah!#Ad rub uds too,' added #Barney.'Frob the cuttry, but subthig in your way, or I'b bistaked.'#Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.Mounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass, from which secret post he could see #MrC taking cold beef from the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses of both to #Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his pleasure.'Aha!' he whispered, looking round to #Barney,'I like that fellow's looks.He'd be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already. Do n't make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear'em talk -- let me hear'em.'He again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the partition, listened attentively:with a subtle and eager look upon his face, that might have appertained to some old goblin.'So I mean to be a gentleman,' said #MrC, kicking out his legs, and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which #Fagin had arrived too late to hear.'No more jolly old coffins, #Charlotte, but a gentleman's life for me:and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.''I should like that well enough, dear,' replied #Charlotte;'but tills ai n't to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.''Tills be blowed!' said #MrC;'there's more things besides tills to be emptied.''What do you mean?' asked his companion.'Pockets, women's ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!' said #MrC, rising with the porter.'But you ca n't do all that, dear,' said #Charlotte.'I shall look out to get into company with them as can,' replied #Noah.'They'll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why, you yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.''Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!' exclaimed #Charlotte, imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face.'There, that'll do:do n't yer be too affectionate, in case I'm cross with yer,' said #Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity.'I should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of'em, and follering'em about, unbeknown to themselves.That would suit me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound note you've got, -- especially as we do n't very well know how to get rid of it ourselves.'After expressing this opinion, #MrC looked into the porter-pot with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents, nodded condescendingly to #Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed.He was meditating another, when the sudden opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him.The stranger was #MrF.And very amiable he looked, and a very low bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest table, ordered something to drink of the grinning #Barney.'A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,' said #Fagin, rubbing his hands.'From the country, I see, sir?''How do yer see that?' asked #NoahClaypole.'We have not so much dust as that in #London,' replied #Fagin, pointing from #Noah's shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two bundles.'Yer a sharp feller,' said #Noah.'Ha! ha! only hear that, #Charlotte!''Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,' replied the Jew, sinking his voice to a confidential whisper;'and that's the truth.'#Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefinger, -- a gesture which #Noah attempted to imitate, though not with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose.However, #MrF seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and put about the liquor which #Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly manner.'Good stuff that,' observed #MrC, smacking his lips.'Dear!' said #Fagin.'A man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or a woman's reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he drinks it regularly.'#Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to #Charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror.'Do n't mind me, my dear,' said #Fagin, drawing his chair closer.'Ha! ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very lucky it was only me.''I did n't take it,' stammered #Noah, no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair;'it was all her doing; yer've got it now, #Charlotte, yer know yer have.''No matter who's got it, or who did it, my dear,' replied #Fagin, glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk's eye at the girl and the two bundles.'I'm in that way myself, and I like you for it.''In what way?' asked #MrC, a little recovering.'In that way of business,' rejoined #Fagin;'and so are the people of the house.You've hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe here as you could be.There is not a safer place in all this town than is the #Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so.And I have taken a fancy to you and the young woman; so I've said the word, and you may make your minds easy.'#Noah #Claypole's mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into various uncouth positions:eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion.'I'll tell you more,' said #Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements.'I have got a friend that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.''Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,' replied #Noah.'What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?' inquired #Fagin, shrugging his shoulders.'Here!Let me have a word with you outside.''There's no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,' said #Noah, getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again.'She'll take the luggage upstairs the while.#Charlotte, see to them bundles.'This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed without the slightest demur; and #Charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while #Noah held the door open and watched her out.'She's kept tolerably well under, ai n't she?' he asked as he resumed his seat:in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal.'Quite perfect,' rejoined #Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder.'You're a genius, my dear.''Why, I suppose if I was n't, I should n't be here,' replied #Noah.'But, I say, she'll be back if yer lose time.''Now, what do you think?' said #Fagin.'If you was to like my friend, could you do better than join him?''Is he in a good way of business; that's where it is!' responded #Noah, winking one of his little eyes.'The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best society in the profession.''Regular town-maders?' asked #MrC.'Not a countryman among'em; and I do n't think he'd take you, even on my recommendation, if he did n't run rather short of assistants just now,' replied #Fagin.'Should I have to hand over?' said #Noah, slapping his breeches-pocket.'It could n't possibly be done without,' replied #Fagin, in a most decided manner.'Twenty pound, though -- it's a lot of money!''Not when it's in a note you ca n't get rid of,' retorted #Fagin.'Number and date taken, I suppose?#Payment stopped at the #Bank? Ah!It's not worth much to him.It'll have to go abroad, and he could n't sell it for a great deal in the market.''When could I see him?' asked #Noah doubtfully.'To-morrow morning.''Where?''Here.''Um!' said #Noah.'What's the wages?''Live like a gentleman -- board and lodging, pipes and spirits free -- half of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,' replied #MrF.Whether #NoahClaypole, whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely things had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought that would suit him.'But, yer see,' observed #Noah,'as she will be able to do a good deal, I should like to take something very light.''A little fancy work?' suggested #Fagin.'Ah! something of that sort,' replied #Noah.'What do you think would suit me now?Something not too trying for the strength, and not very dangerous, you know.That's the sort of thing!''I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my dear,' said #Fagin.'My friend wants somebody who would do that well, very much.''Why, I did mention that, and I should n't mind turning my hand to it sometimes,' rejoined #MrC slowly;'but it would n't pay by itself, you know.''That's true!' observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate.'No, it might not.''What do you think, then?' asked #Noah, anxiously regarding him.'Something in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not much more risk than being at home.''What do you think of the old ladies?' asked #Fagin.'There's a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running round the corner.''Do n't they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?' asked #Noah, shaking his head.'I do n't think that would answer my purpose.Ai n't there any other line open?''Stop!' said #Fagin, laying his hand on #Noah's knee.'The kinchin lay.''What's that?' demanded #MrC.'The kinchins, my dear,' said #Fagin,'is the young children that's sent on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay is just to take their money away -- they've always got it ready in their hands, -- then knock'em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself.#Ha! ha! ha!''Ha! ha!' roared #MrC, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy.'Lord, that's the very thing!''To be sure it is,' replied #Fagin;'and you can have a few good beats chalked out in #CamdenTown, and #BattleBridge, and neighborhoods like that, where they're always going errands; and you can upset as many kinchins as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!'With this, #Fagin poked #MrC in the side, and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud.'Well, that's all right!' said #Noah, when he had recovered himself, and #Charlotte had returned.'What time to-morrow shall we say?''Will ten do?' asked #Fagin, adding, as #MrC nodded assent,'What name shall I tell my good friend.''Mr. #Bolter,' replied #Noah, who had prepared himself for such emergency.'Mr. #MorrisBolter.This is #MrsBolter.''#MrsBolter's humble servant,' said #Fagin, bowing with grotesque politeness.'I hope I shall know her better very shortly.''Do you hear the gentleman, #Charlotte?' thundered #MrC.'Yes, #Noah, dear!' replied #MrsBolter, extending her hand.'She calls me #Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,' said #MrM, late Claypole, turning to #Fagin.'You understand?''Oh yes, I understand -- perfectly,' replied #Fagin, telling the truth for once.'Good-night!Good-night!'With many adieus and good wishes, #MrF went his way. #NoahClaypole, bespeaking his good lady's attention, proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex, but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay, in #London and its vicinity.CHAPTER #XLIII#WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE #ARTFUL DODGER GOT #INTO TROUBLE'And so it was you that was your own friend, was it?' asked #MrC, otherwise #Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into between them, he had removed next day to #Fagin's house.''Cod, I thought as much last night!''Every man's his own friend, my dear,' replied #Fagin, with his most insinuating grin.'He has n't as good a one as himself anywhere.''Except sometimes,' replied #MorrisBolter, assuming the air of a man of the world.'Some people are nobody's enemies but their own, yer know.''Do n't believe that,' said #Fagin.'When a man's his own enemy, it's only because he's too much his own friend; not because he's careful for everybody but himself.#Pooh! pooh!There ai n't such a thing in nature.''There ough n't to be, if there is,' replied #MrB.'That stands to reason.Some conjurers say that number three is the magic number, and some say number seven.It's neither, my friend, neither.It's number one.'Ha! ha!' cried #MrB.'Number one for ever.''In a little community like ours, my dear,' said #Fagin, who felt it necessary to qualify this position,'we have a general number one, without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.''Oh, the devil!' exclaimed #MrB.'You see,' pursued #Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption,'we are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must be so.For instance, it's your object to take care of number one -- meaning yourself.''Certainly,' replied #MrB.'Yer about right there.''Well!You ca n't take care of yourself, number one, without taking care of me, number one.''Number two, you mean,' said #MrB, who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness.'No, I do n't!' retorted #Fagin.'I'm of the same importance to you, as you are to yourself.''I say,' interrupted #MrB,'yer a very nice man, and I'm very fond of yer; but we ai n't quite so thick together, as all that comes to.''Only think,' said #Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out his hands;'only consider.You've done what's a very pretty thing, and what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat, that's so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose -- in plain #English, the halter!'#MrBolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not in substance.'The gallows,' continued #Fagin,'the gallows, my dear, is an ugly finger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellow's career on the broad highway.To keep in the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with you.''Of course it is,' replied #MrB.'What do yer talk about such things for?''Only to show you my meaning clearly,' said the Jew, raising his eyebrows.'To be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my little business all snug, I depend upon you. The first is your number one, the second my number one.The more you value your number one, the more careful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at first -- that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must do so, unless we would all go to pieces in company.''That's true,' rejoined #MrB, thoughtfully.'Oh! yer a cunning old codger!'#MrFagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance.To strengthen an impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that #MrB's respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.'It's this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses,' said #Fagin.'My best hand was taken from me, yesterday morning.''You do n't mean to say he died?' cried #MrB.'No, no,' replied #Fagin,'not so bad as that.Not quite so bad.''What, I suppose he was --''Wanted,' interposed #Fagin.'Yes, he was wanted.''Very particular?' inquired #MrB.'No,' replied #Fagin,'not very.He was charged with attempting to pick a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him, -- his own, my dear, his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it.They remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner.#Ah! he was worth fifty boxes, and I'd give the price of as many to have him back.You should have known the #Dodger, my dear; you should have known the Dodger.''Well, but I shall know him, I hope; do n't yer think so?' said #MrB.'I'm doubtful about it,' replied #Fagin, with a sigh.'If they do n't get any fresh evidence, it'll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it's a case of lagging.They know what a clever lad he is; he'll be a lifer.They'll make the #Artful nothing less than a lifer.''What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?' demanded #MrB.'What's the good of talking in that way to me; why do n't yer speak so as I can understand yer?'#Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, #MrB would have been informed that they represented that combination of words,'transportation for life,' when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of #MasterBates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face twisted into a look of semi-comical woe.'It's all up, #Fagin,' said #Charley, when he and his new companion had been made known to each other.'What do you mean?''They've found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more's a coming to'dentify him; and the #Artful's booked for a passage out,' replied #MasterBates.'I must have a full suit of mourning, #Fagin, and a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels.To think of #JackDawkins -- lummy #Jack -- the Dodger -- the #Artful Dodger -- going abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box!I never thought he'd a done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest. Oh, why did n't he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and go out as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour nor glory!'With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, #MasterBates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency.'What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!' exclaimed #Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil.'Was n't he always the top-sawyer among you all!Is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent!#Eh?''Not one,' replied #MasterBates, in a voice rendered husky by regret;'not one.''Then what do you talk of?' replied #Fagin angrily;'what are you blubbering for?'''Cause it is n't on the rec-ord, is it?' said #Charley, chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets;''cause it ca n't come out in the'dictment;'cause nobody will never know half of what he was.How will he stand in the #NewgateCalendar? P'raps not be there at all.Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!''Ha! ha!' cried #Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to #MrB in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy;'see what a pride they take in their profession, my dear.Ai n't it beautiful?'#MrBolter nodded assent, and #Fagin, after contemplating the grief of #CharleyBates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder.'Never mind, #Charley,' said #Fagin soothingly;'it'll come out, it'll be sure to come out.They'll all know what a clever fellow he was; he'll show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers.#Think how young he is too!What a distinction, #Charley, to be lagged at his time of life!''Well, it is a honour that is!' said #Charley, a little consoled.'He shall have all he wants,' continued the Jew.'He shall be kept in the Stone Jug, #Charley, like a gentleman.Like a gentleman!With his beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he ca n't spend it.''No, shall he though?' cried #CharleyBates.'Ay, that he shall,' replied #Fagin,'and we'll have a big-wig, #Charley: one that's got the greatest gift of the gab:to carry on his defence; and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we'll read it all in the papers --'' #ArtfulDodger -- shrieks of laughter -- here the court was convulsed'' -- eh, #Charley, eh?''Ha! ha!' laughed #MasterBates,'what a lark that would be, would n't it, #Fagin?I say, how the #Artful would bother'em would n't he?''Would!' cried #Fagin.'He shall -- he will!''Ah, to be sure, so he will,' repeated #Charley, rubbing his hands.'I think I see him now,' cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil.'So do I,' cried #CharleyBates.'Ha! ha! ha! so do I.I see it all afore me, upon my soul I do, #Fagin.What a game!What a regular game! All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and #JackDawkins addressing of'em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge's own son making a speech arter dinner -- ha! ha! ha!'In fact, #MrF had so well humoured his young friend's eccentric disposition, that #MasterBates, who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned #Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities.'We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,' said #Fagin.'Let me think.''Shall I go?' asked #Charley.'Not for the world,' replied #Fagin.'Are you mad, my dear, stark mad, that you'd walk into the very place where -- No, #Charley, no. One is enough to lose at a time.''You do n't mean to go yourself, I suppose?' said #Charley with a humorous leer.'That would n't quite fit,' replied #Fagin shaking his head.'Then why do n't you send this new cove?' asked #MasterBates, laying his hand on #Noah's arm.'Nobody knows him.''Why, if he did n't mind --' observed #Fagin.'Mind!' interposed #Charley.'What should he have to mind?''Really nothing, my dear,' said #Fagin, turning to #MrB,'really nothing.''Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,' observed #Noah, backing towards the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm.'No, no -- none of that.It's not in my department, that ai n't.''Wot department has he got, #Fagin?' inquired #MasterBates, surveying #Noah's lank form with much disgust.'The cutting away when there's anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there's everything right; is that his branch?''Never mind,' retorted #MrB;'and do n't yer take liberties with yer superiors, little boy, or yer'll find yerself in the wrong shop.'#Master #Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it was some time before #Fagin could interpose, and represent to #MrB that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office; that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to the metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in #London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will.#Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of #Fagin, #MrB at length consented, with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By #Fagin's directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner's frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings:all of which articles the #Jew had at hand.He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter's whip.Thus equipped, he was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from #CoventGarden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow as need be, #MrF had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection.These arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the #ArtfulDodger, and was conveyed by #MasterBates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of #BowStreet. #Having described the precise situation of the office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off his hat as he went into the room, #CharleyBates bade him hurry on alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting.#NoahClaypole, or #MorrisBolter as the reader pleases, punctually followed the directions he had received, which -- #MasterBates being pretty well acquainted with the locality -- were so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question, or meeting with any interruption by the way.He found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full majesty of justice.There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table.A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some woman'Take that baby out,' when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother's shawl, from some meagre infant.The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened.There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the dock -- the only thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it.#Noah looked eagerly about him for the #Dodger; but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished character's mother or sister, and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all answering the description given him of #MrD was to be seen.He waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women, being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit.It was indeed #MrD, who, shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that'ere disgraceful sitivation for.'Hold your tongue, will you?' said the jailer.'I'm an Englishman, ai n't I?' rejoined the Dodger.'Where are my priwileges?''You'll get your privileges soon enough,' retorted the jailer, #'and pepper with'em.''We'll see wot the Secretary of State for the #HomeAffairs has got to say to the beaks, if I do n't,' replied #MrD.'Now then!#Wot is this here business?I shall thank the madg'strates to dispose of this here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for I've got an appointment with a genelman in the #City, and as I am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he'll go away if I ai n't there to my time, and then pr'aps ther wo n't be an action for damage against them as kep me away.Oh no, certainly not!'At this point, the #Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to communicate'the names of them two files as was on the bench.'Which so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as #MasterBates could have done if he had heard the request.'Silence there!' cried the jailer.'What is this?' inquired one of the magistrates.'A pick-pocketing case, your worship.''Has the boy ever been here before?''He ought to have been, a many times,' replied the jailer.'He has been pretty well everywhere else._I_ know him well, your worship.''Oh! you know me, do you?' cried the #Artful, making a note of the statement.'Wery good.That's a case of deformation of character, any way.'Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.'Now then, where are the witnesses?' said the clerk.'Ah! that's right,' added the Dodger.'Where are they?I should like to see'em.'This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own countenance.For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him, and the said #Dodger, being searched, had upon his person a silver snuff-box, with the owner's name engraved upon the lid.This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to.He had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making his way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him.'Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?' said the magistrate.'I would n't abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him,' replied the Dodger.'Have you anything to say at all?''Do you hear his worship ask if you've anything to say?' inquired the jailer, nudging the silent #Dodger with his elbow.'I beg your pardon,' said the #Dodger, looking up with an air of abstraction.'Did you redress yourself to me, my man?''I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,' observed the officer with a grin.'Do you mean to say anything, you young shaver?''No,' replied the #Dodger,'not here, for this ai n't the shop for justice:besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with the #Wice President of the #House of #Commons; but I shall have something to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and'spectable circle of acquaintance as'll make them beaks wish they'd never been born, or that they'd got their footmen to hang'em up to their own hat-pegs, afore they let'em come out this morning to try it on upon me.I'll --''There!He's fully committed!' interposed the clerk.'Take him away.''Come on,' said the jailer.'Oh ah!I'll come on,' replied the #Dodger, brushing his hat with the palm of his hand.'Ah! (to the #Bench) it's no use your looking frightened; I wo n't show you no mercy, not a ha'porth of it._You'll_ pay for this, my fine fellers.I would n't be you for something!I would n't go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me.Here, carry me off to prison!#Take me away!'With these last words, the #Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary business of it; and then grinning in the officer's face, with great glee and self-approval.Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, #Noah made the best of his way back to where he had left #MasterBates. After waiting here some time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person.The two hastened back together, to bear to #MrF the animating news that the #Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and establishing for himself a glorious reputation.CHAPTER #XLIVTHE #TIME #ARRIVESFOR NANCY TO #REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE. SHE FAILS.#Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl #Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind.She remembered that both the crafty Jew and the brutal #Sikes had confided to her schemes, which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion.Vile as those schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were her feelings towards #Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape; still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last -- richly as he merited such a fate -- by her hand.But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration.Her fears for #Sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her -- and what more could she do! She was resolved.Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too. She grew pale and thin, even within a few days.At times, she took no heed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where once, she would have been the loudest.At other times, she laughed without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards -- she sat silent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions.It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour.Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen.The girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too.Eleven.'An hour this side of midnight,' said #Sikes, raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat.'Dark and heavy it is too. A good night for business this.''Ah!' replied #Fagin.'What a pity, #Bill, my dear, that there's none quite ready to be done.''You're right for once,' replied #Sikes gruffly.'It is a pity, for I'm in the humour too.'#Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.'We must make up for lost time when we've got things into a good train. That's all I know,' said #Sikes.'That's the way to talk, my dear,' replied #Fagin, venturing to pat him on the shoulder.'It does me good to hear you.''Does you good, does it!' cried #Sikes.'Well, so be it.''Ha! ha! ha!' laughed #Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this concession.'You're like yourself to-night, #Bill.#Quite like yourself.''I do n't feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder, so take it away,' said #Sikes, casting off the #Jew's hand.'It make you nervous, #Bill, -- reminds you of being nabbed, does it?' said #Fagin, determined not to be offended.'Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,' returned #Sikes.'There never was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father, and I suppose _he_ is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time, unless you came straight from the old'un without any father at all betwixt you; which I should n't wonder at, a bit.'#Fagin offered no reply to this compliment:but, pulling #Sikes by the sleeve, pointed his finger towards #Nancy, who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving the room.'Hallo!' cried #Sikes.'Nance.Where's the gal going to at this time of night?''Not far.''What answer's that?' retorted #Sikes.'Do you hear me?''I do n't know where,' replied the girl.'Then I do,' said #Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed.'Nowhere.#Sit down.''I'm not well.I told you that before,' rejoined the girl.'I want a breath of air.''Put your head out of the winder,' replied #Sikes.'There's not enough there,' said the girl.'I want it in the street.''Then you wo n't have it,' replied #Sikes.With which assurance he rose, locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her head, flung it up to the top of an old press.'There,' said the robber.'Now stop quietly where you are, will you?''It's not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,' said the girl turning very pale.'What do you mean, #Bill?Do you know what you're doing?''Know what I'm -- Oh!' cried #Sikes, turning to #Fagin,'she's out of her senses, you know, or she dare n't talk to me in that way.''You'll drive me on the something desperate,' muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak.'Let me go, will you, -- this minute -- this instant.''No!' said #Sikes.'Tell him to let me go, #Fagin.He had better.It'll be better for him.Do you hear me?' cried #Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.'Hear you!' repeated #Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her.'Aye!And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such a grip on your throat as'll tear some of that screaming voice out. #Wot has come over you, you jade!#Wot is it?''Let me go,' said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself down on the floor, before the door, she said,'Bill, let me go; you do n't know what you are doing. You do n't, indeed.For only one hour -- do -- do!''Cut my limbs off one by one!' cried #Sikes, seizing her roughly by the arm,'If I do n't think the gal's stark raving mad.Get up.''Not till you let me go -- not till you let me go -- Never -- never!' screamed the girl.#Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by force.She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o'clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any further.With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to go out that night, #Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined #Fagin.'Whew!' said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face.'Wot a precious strange gal that is!''You may say that, #Bill,' replied #Fagin thoughtfully.'You may say that.''Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you think?' asked #Sikes.'Come; you should know her better than me. #Wot does it mean?''Obstinacy; woman's obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.''Well, I suppose it is,' growled #Sikes.'I thought I had tamed her, but she's as bad as ever.''Worse,' said #Fagin thoughtfully.'I never knew her like this, for such a little cause.''Nor I,' said #Sikes.'I think she's got a touch of that fever in her blood yet, and it wo n't come out -- eh?''Like enough.''I'll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she's took that way again,' said #Sikes.#Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.'She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself aloof,' said #Sikes.'We was poor too, all the time, and I think, one way or other, it's worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here so long has made her restless -- eh?''That's it, my dear,' replied the Jew in a whisper.'Hush!'As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat.Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.'Why, now she's on the other tack!' exclaimed #Sikes, turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion.#Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, #Fagin took up his hat and bade him good-night.He paused when he reached the room-door, and looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.'Light him down,' said #Sikes, who was filling his pipe.'It's a pity he should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers.Show him a light.'#Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle.When they reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl, said, in a whisper.'What is it, #Nancy, dear?''What do you mean?' replied the girl, in the same tone.'The reason of all this,' replied #Fagin.'If _he_' -- he pointed with his skinny fore-finger up the stairs --'is so hard with you (he's a brute, #Nance, a brute-beast), why do n't you --''Well?' said the girl, as #Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching her ear, and his eyes looking into hers.'No matter just now.We'll talk of this again.You have a friend in me, #Nance; a staunch friend.I have the means at hand, quiet and close.If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog -- like a dog!worse than his dog, for he humours him sometimes -- come to me.I say, come to me.He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, #Nance.''I know you well,' replied the girl, without manifesting the least emotion.'Good-night.'She shrank back, as #Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.#Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain.He had conceived the idea -- not from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by degrees -- that #Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker's brutality, had conceived an attachment for some new friend.Her altered manner, her repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him at least, almost matter of certainty.The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons.He would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as #Nancy, and must (thus #Fagin argued) be secured without delay.There was another, and a darker object, to be gained.#Sikes knew too much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the wounds were hidden.The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely wreaked -- to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life -- on the object of her more recent fancy.'With a little persuasion,' thought #Fagin,'what more likely than that she would consent to poison him?Women have done such things, and worse, to secure the same object before now.There would be the dangerous villain:the man I hate:gone; another secured in his place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited.'These things passed through the mind of #Fagin, during the short time he sat alone, in the housebreaker's room; and with them uppermost in his thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting.There was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning.The girl clearly comprehended it.Her glance at parting showed _that_.But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of #Sikes, and that was one of the chief ends to be attained.'How,' thought #Fagin, as he crept homeward,'can I increase my influence with her?What new power can I acquire?'Such brains are fertile in expedients.If, without extracting a confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to #Sikes (of whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs, could he not secure her compliance?'I can,' said #Fagin, almost aloud.'She durst not refuse me then.Not for her life, not for her life!I have it all.The means are ready, and shall be set to work.I shall have you yet!'He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way: busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers.CHAPTER #XLV#NOAH #CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A #SECRET MISSIONThe old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast.'Bolter,' said #Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite #MorrisBolter.'Well, here I am,' returned #Noah.'What's the matter?Do n't yer ask me to do anything till I have done eating. That's a great fault in this place.Yer never get time enough over yer meals.''You can talk as you eat, ca n't you?' said #Fagin, cursing his dear young friend's greediness from the very bottom of his heart.'Oh yes, I can talk.I get on better when I talk,' said #Noah, cutting a monstrous slice of bread.'Where's #Charlotte?''Out,' said #Fagin.'I sent her out this morning with the other young woman, because I wanted us to be alone.''Oh!' said #Noah.'I wish yer'd ordered her to make some buttered toast first.Well.#Talk away.Yer wo n't interrupt me.'There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business.'You did well yesterday, my dear,' said #Fagin.'Beautiful!Six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day!The kinchin lay will be a fortune to you.''Do n't you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,' said #MrB.'No, no, my dear.The pint-pots were great strokes of genius: but the milk-can was a perfect masterpiece.''Pretty well, I think, for a beginner,' remarked #MrB complacently.'The pots I took off airy railings, and the milk-can was standing by itself outside a public-house.I thought it might get rusty with the rain, or catch cold, yer know.#Eh?#Ha! ha! ha!'#Fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and #MrB having had his laugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second.'I want you, #Bolter,' said #Fagin, leaning over the table,'to do a piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.''I say,' rejoined #Bolter,'do n't yer go shoving me into danger, or sending me any more o' yer police-offices. That do n't suit me, that do n't; and so I tell yer.''That's not the smallest danger in it -- not the very smallest,' said the #Jew;'it's only to dodge a woman.''An old woman?' demanded #MrB.'A young one,' replied #Fagin.'I can do that pretty well, I know,' said #Bolter.'I was a regular cunning sneak when I was at school.What am I to dodge her for?Not to --''Not to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and, if possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street, or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the information you can.''What'll yer give me?' asked #Noah, setting down his cup, and looking his employer, eagerly, in the face.'If you do it well, a pound, my dear.One pound,' said #Fagin, wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible.'And that's what I never gave yet, for any job of work where there was n't valuable consideration to be gained.''Who is she?' inquired #Noah.'One of us.''Oh Lor!' cried #Noah, curling up his nose.'Yer doubtful of her, are yer?''She has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they are,' replied #Fagin.'I see,' said #Noah.'Just to have the pleasure of knowing them, if they're respectable people, eh?#Ha! ha! ha! I'm your man.''I knew you would be,' cried #Fagin, elated by the success of his proposal.'Of course, of course,' replied #Noah.'Where is she? Where am I to wait for her?Where am I to go?''All that, my dear, you shall hear from me.I'll point her out at the proper time,' said #Fagin.'You keep ready, and leave the rest to me.'That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter's dress:ready to turn out at a word from #Fagin.Six nights passed -- six long weary nights -- and on each, #Fagin came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet time.On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he could not conceal.It was Sunday.'She goes abroad to-night,' said #Fagin, #'and on the right errand, I'm sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak.Come with me. #Quick!'#Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him.They left the house stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at length before a public-house, which #Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in #London.It was past eleven o'clock, and the door was closed.It opened softly on its hinges as #Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise; and the door was closed behind them.Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words, #Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of glass to #Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room.'Is that the woman?' he asked, scarcely above his breath.#Fagin nodded yes.'I ca n't see her face well,' whispered #Noah.'She is looking down, and the candle is behind her.'Stay there,' whispered #Fagin.He signed to #Barney, who withdrew.In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to the girl, caused her to raise her face.'I see her now,' cried the spy.'Plainly?''I should know her among a thousand.'He hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out. #Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.'Hist!' cried the lad who held the door.'Dow.'#Noah exchanged a look with #Fagin, and darted out.'To the left,' whispered the lad;'take the left had, and keep od the other side.'He did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl's retreating figure, already at some distance before him.He advanced as near as he considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the better to observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her, pass on.She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk with a steadier and firmer step.The spy preserved the same relative distance between them, and followed:with his eye upon her.CHAPTER #XLVITHE #APPOINTMENT KEPTThe church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures emerged on #LondonBridge.One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance, accommodated his pace to hers:stopping when she stopped:and as she moved again, creeping stealthily on:but never allowing himself, in the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps.Thus, they crossed the bridge, from the #Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers, turned back.The movement was sudden; but he who watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement. When she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed her again. At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped.The man stopped too.It was a very dark night.The day had been unfavourable, and at that hour and place there were few people stirring. Such as there were, hurried quickly past:very possibly without seeing, but certainly without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view. Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of #London's destitute population, as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence:neither speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks. The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes. The tower of old Saint Saviour's #Church, and the spire of #SaintMagnus, so long the giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro -- closely watched meanwhile by her hidden observer -- when the heavy bell of #St. #Paul's tolled for the death of another day.#Midnight had come upon the crowded city.The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child:midnight was upon them all.The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked straight towards it.They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl started, and immediately made towards them.They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate. They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close up -- brushed against them, indeed -- at that precise moment.'Not here,' said #Nancy hurriedly,'I am afraid to speak to you here. Come away -- out of the public road -- down the steps yonder!'As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the #Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as #SaintSaviour's #Church, form a landing-stairs from the river.To this spot, the man bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after a moment's survey of the place, he began to descend.These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights. Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the #Thames. At this point the lower steps widen:so that a person turning that angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him, if only a step. The countryman looked hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there waited:pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with safety.So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation.He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place, and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely breathing, listened attentively.'This is far enough,' said a voice, which was evidently that of the gentleman.'I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther.Many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but you see I am willing to humour you.''To humour me!' cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed.'You're considerate, indeed, sir.To humour me!#Well, well, it's no matter.''Why, for what,' said the gentleman in a kinder tone,'for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place?Why not have let me speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?''I told you before,' replied #Nancy,'that I was afraid to speak to you there.I do n't know why it is,' said the girl, shuddering,'but I have such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.''A fear of what?' asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her.'I scarcely know of what,' replied the girl.'I wish I did. Horrible thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day.I was reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the print.''Imagination,' said the gentleman, soothing her.'No imagination,' replied the girl in a hoarse voice.'I'll swear I saw ``coffin'' written in every page of the book in large black letters, -- aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets to-night.''There is nothing unusual in that,' said the gentleman.'They have passed me often.''_Real ones_,' rejoined the girl.'This was not.'There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and the blood chilled within him.He had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies.'Speak to her kindly,' said the young lady to her companion.'Poor creature!She seems to need it.''Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,' cried the girl.'Oh, dear lady, why ar'n't those who claim to be #God's own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth, and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud instead of so much humbler?''Ah!' said the gentleman.'A #Turk turns his face, after washing it well, to the #East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of #Heaven. Between the #Mussulman and the #Pharisee, commend me to the first!'These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording #Nancy time to recover herself.The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her.'You were not here last Sunday night,' he said.'I could n't come,' replied #Nancy;'I was kept by force.''By whom?''Him that I told the young lady of before.''You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?' asked the old gentleman.'No,' replied the girl, shaking her head.'It's not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why; I could n't give him a drink of laudanum before I came away.''Did he awake before you returned?' inquired the gentleman.'No; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.''Good,' said the gentleman.'Now listen to me.''I am ready,' replied the girl, as he paused for a moment.'This young lady,' the gentleman began,'has communicated to me, and to some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly a fortnight since.I confess to you that I had doubts, at first, whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe you are.''I am,' said the girl earnestly.'I repeat that I firmly believe it.To prove to you that I am disposed to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks.But if -- if --' said the gentleman,'he can not be secured, or, if secured, can not be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.''Fagin,' cried the girl, recoiling.'That man must be delivered up by you,' said the gentleman.'I will not do it!I will never do it!' replied the girl.'Devil that he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do that.''You will not?' said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this answer.'Never!' returned the girl.'Tell me why?''For one reason,' rejoined the girl firmly,'for one reason, that the lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her promise:and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same courses together, and I'll not turn upon them, who might -- any of them -- have turned upon me, but did n't, bad as they are.''Then,' said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain;'put Monks into my hands, and leave him to me to deal with.''What if he turns against the others?''I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him, there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in #Oliver's little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye, and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.''And if it is not?' suggested the girl.'Then,' pursued the gentleman,'this Fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent.In such a case I could show you reasons, I think, which would induce you to yield it.''Have I the lady's promise for that?' asked the girl.'You have,' replied #Rose.'My true and faithful pledge.''Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?' said the girl, after a short pause.'Never,' replied the gentleman.'The intelligence should be brought to bear upon him, that he could never even guess.''I have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,' said the girl after another interval of silence,'but I will take your words.'After receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so, she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by name and situation, the public-house whence she had been followed that night.From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated.When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation, and the night and hour on which #Monks was most in the habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection.'He is tall,' said the girl,'and a strongly made man, but not stout; he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Do n't forget that, for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man's, that you might almost tell him by that alone.His face is dark, like his hair and eyes; and, although he ca n't be more than six or eight and twenty, withered and haggard. His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds -- why did you start?' said the girl, stopping suddenly.The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious of having done so, and begged her to proceed.'Part of this,' said the girl,'I have drawn out from other people at the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times he was covered up in a large cloak.I think that's all I can give you to know him by.Stay though,' she added.'Upon his throat:so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face:there is --''A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?' cried the gentleman.'How's this?' said the girl.'You know him!'The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.'I think I do,' said the gentleman, breaking silence.'I should by your description.We shall see.Many people are singularly like each other.It may not be the same.'As he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter,'It must be he!''Now,' he said, returning:so it seemed by the sound:to the spot where he had stood before,'you have given us most valuable assistance, young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to serve you?''Nothing,' replied #Nancy.'You will not persist in saying that,' rejoined the gentleman, with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart.'Think now.#Tell me.''Nothing, sir,' rejoined the girl, weeping.'You can do nothing to help me.I am past all hope, indeed.''You put yourself beyond its pale,' said the gentleman.'The past has been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such priceless treasures lavished, as the #Creator bestows but once and never grants again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in #England, or, if you fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. Before the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment.Come!I would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion, or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you.Quit them all, while there is time and opportunity!''She will be persuaded now,' cried the young lady.'She hesitates, I am sure.''I fear not, my dear,' said the gentleman.'No sir, I do not,' replied the girl, after a short struggle.'I am chained to my old life.I loathe and hate it now, but I can not leave it.I must have gone too far to turn back, -- and yet I do n't know, for if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off.But,' she said, looking hastily round,'this fear comes over me again.I must go home.''Home!' repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word.'Home, lady,' rejoined the girl.'To such a home as I have raised for myself with the work of my whole life.Let us part. I shall be watched or seen.#Go!#Go!If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you leave me, and let me go my way alone.''It is useless,' said the gentleman, with a sigh.'We compromise her safety, perhaps, by staying here.We may have detained her longer than she expected already.''Yes, yes,' urged the girl.'You have.''What,' cried the young lady,'can be the end of this poor creature's life!''What!' repeated the girl.'Look before you, lady.Look at that dark water.How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them.It may be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at last.''Do not speak thus, pray,' returned the young lady, sobbing.'It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and #God forbid such horrors should!' replied the girl.'Good-night, good-night!'The gentleman turned away.'This purse,' cried the young lady.'Take it for my sake, that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.''No!' replied the girl.'I have not done this for money.Let me have that to think of.And yet -- give me something that you have worn:I should like to have something -- no, no, not a ring -- your gloves or handkerchief -- anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you, sweet lady.There.Bless you!God bless you. Good-night, good-night!'The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested.The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased.The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge.They stopped at the summit of the stairs.'Hark!' cried the young lady, listening.'Did she call!I thought I heard her voice.''No, my love,' replied #MrB, looking sadly back.'She has not moved, and will not till we are gone.'#Rose #Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his, and led her, with gentle force, away.As they disappeared, the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears.After a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street.The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in the same manner as he had descended.Peeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that he was unobserved, #NoahClaypole darted away at his utmost speed, and made for the #Jew's house as fast as his legs would carry him.CHAPTER #XLVII#FATAL CONSEQUENCESIt was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still and silent hour, that #Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil spirit.He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet, with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side.His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in thought, he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog's or rat's.Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay #NoahClaypole, fast asleep. Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.Indeed they were.Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on #Sikes; the fear of detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain of #Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart.He sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street.'At last,' he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth.'At last!'The bell rang gently as he spoke.He crept upstairs to the door, and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of #Sikes.'There!' he said, laying the bundle on the table.'Take care of that, and do the most you can with it.It's been trouble enough to get; I thought I should have been here, three hours ago.'#Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat down again without speaking.But he did not take his eyes off the robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright.'Wot now?' cried #Sikes.'Wot do you look at a man so for?'#Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the moment gone.'Damme!' said #Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm.'He's gone mad.I must look to myself here.''No, no,' rejoined #Fagin, finding his voice.'It's not -- you're not the person, #Bill.I've no -- no fault to find with you.''Oh, you have n't, have n't you?' said #Sikes, looking sternly at him, and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket.'That's lucky -- for one of us.Which one that is, do n't matter.''I've got that to tell you, #Bill,' said #Fagin, drawing his chair nearer,'will make you worse than me.''Aye?' returned the robber with an incredulous air.'Tell away! Look sharp, or #Nance will think I'm lost.''Lost!' cried #Fagin.'She has pretty well settled that, in her own mind, already.'#Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the #Jew's face, and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.'Speak, will you!' he said;'or if you do n't, it shall be for want of breath.Open your mouth and say wot you've got to say in plain words. Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!''Suppose that lad that's laying there --' #Fagin began.#Sikes turned round to where #Noah was sleeping, as if he had not previously observed him.'Well!' he said, resuming his former position.'Suppose that lad,' pursued #Fagin,'was to peach -- to blow upon us all -- first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having a meeting with'em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be most easily taken.Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow upon a plant we've all been in, more or less -- of his own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and water, -- but of his own fancy; to please his own taste; stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and peaching to them.Do you hear me?' cried the Jew, his eyes flashing with rage.'Suppose he did all this, what then?''What then!' replied #Sikes; with a tremendous oath.'If he was left alive till I came, I'd grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.''What if I did it!' cried #Fagin almost in a yell.'I, that knows so much, and could hang so many besides myself!''I do n't know,' replied #Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion.'I'd do something in the jail that'ud get me put in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I'd fall upon you with them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people. I should have such strength,' muttered the robber, poising his brawny arm,'that I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it.''You would?''Would I!' said the housebreaker.'Try me.''If it was #Charley, or the #Dodger, or #Bet, or --''I do n't care who,' replied #Sikes impatiently.'Whoever it was, I'd serve them the same.'#Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent, stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse him.Sikes leant forward in his chair:looking on with his hands upon his knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in.'Bolter, #Bolter!#Poor lad!' said #Fagin, looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis.'He's tired -- tired with watching for her so long, -- watching for _her_, #Bill.''Wot d'ye mean?' asked #Sikes, drawing back.#Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him into a sitting posture.When his assumed name had been repeated several times, #Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily about him.'Tell me that again -- once again, just for him to hear,' said the Jew, pointing to #Sikes as he spoke.'Tell yer what?' asked the sleepy #Noah, shaking himself pettishly.'That about -- #_Nancy_,' said #Fagin, clutching #Sikes by the wrist, as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough.'You followed her?''Yes.''To #LondonBridge?''Yes.''Where she met two people.''So she did.''A gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before, who asked her to give up all her pals, and #Monks first, which she did -- and to describe him, which she did -- and to tell her what house it was that we meet at, and go to, which she did -- and where it could be best watched from, which she did -- and what time the people went there, which she did.She did all this.She told it all every word without a threat, without a murmur -- she did -- did she not?' cried #Fagin, half mad with fury.'All right,' replied #Noah, scratching his head.'That's just what it was!''What did they say, about last Sunday?''About last Sunday!' replied #Noah, considering.'Why I told yer that before.''Again.Tell it again!' cried #Fagin, tightening his grasp on #Sikes, and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.'They asked her,' said #Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to have a dawning perception who Sikes was,'they asked her why she did n't come, last Sunday, as she promised.She said she could n't.''Why -- why?#Tell him that.''Because she was forcibly kept at home by #Bill, the man she had told them of before,' replied #Noah.'What more of him?' cried #Fagin.'What more of the man she had told them of before?#Tell him that, tell him that.''Why, that she could n't very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to,' said #Noah;'and so the first time she went to see the lady, she -- ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that it did -- she gave him a drink of laudanum.''Hell's fire!' cried #Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew.'Let me go!'Flinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted, wildly and furiously, up the stairs.'Bill, #Bill!' cried #Fagin, following him hastily.'A word. Only a word.'The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door:on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence, when the #Jew came panting up.'Let me out,' said #Sikes.'Do n't speak to me; it's not safe. Let me out, I say!''Hear me speak a word,' rejoined #Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock.'You wo n't be --''Well,' replied the other.'You wo n't be -- too -- violent, #Bill?'The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see each other's faces.They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.'I mean,' said #Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now useless,'not too violent for safety.Be crafty, #Bill, and not too bold.'#Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which #Fagin had turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.Without one pause, or moment's consideration; without once turning his head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering them to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage resolution:his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his own door.He opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the stairs; and entering his own room, double-locked the door, and lifting a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed.The girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it.He had roused her from her sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look.'Get up!' said the man.'It is you, #Bill!' said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his return.'It is,' was the reply.'Get up.'There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick, and hurled it under the grate.Seeing the faint light of early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.'Let it be,' said #Sikes, thrusting his hand before her.'There's enough light for wot I've got to do.''Bill,' said the girl, in the low voice of alarm,'why do you look like that at me!'The robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils and heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat, dragged her into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth.'Bill, #Bill!' gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal fear, --'I -- I wo n't scream or cry -- not once -- hear me -- speak to me -- tell me what I have done!''You know, you she devil!' returned the robber, suppressing his breath.'You were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.''Then spare my life for the love of #Heaven, as I spared yours,' rejoined the girl, clinging to him.'Bill, dear #Bill, you can not have the heart to kill me.Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one night, for you.You _shall_ have time to think, and save yourself this crime; I will not loose my hold, you can not throw me off.#Bill, #Bill, for dear God's sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my blood!I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!'The man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl were clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear them away.'Bill,' cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast,'the gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace.Let me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in prayers, and never see each other more. It is never too late to repent. They told me so -- I feel it now -- but we must have time -- a little, little time!'The housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol. The certainty of immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his own.She staggered and fell:nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty, on her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief -- #RoseMaylie's own -- and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker.It was a ghastly figure to look upon.The murderer staggering backward to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy club and struck her down.CHAPTER #XLVIIITHE #FLIGHTOF SIKESOf all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed within wide #London's bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst.Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that was the foulest and most cruel.The sun -- the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new life, and hope, and freshness to man -- burst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory.Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal ray.It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay. It did.He tried to shut it out, but it would stream in.If the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light!He had not moved; he had been afraid to stir.There had been a moan and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and struck again.Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling.He had plucked it off again.And there was the body -- mere flesh and blood, no more -- but such flesh, and so much blood!He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney.Even that frightened him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes.He washed himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them.How those stains were dispersed about the room!The very feet of the dog were bloody.All this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no, not for a moment.Such preparations completed, he moved, backward, towards the door:dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets. He shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house.He crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside.There was the curtain still drawn, which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again.It lay nearly under there.#_He_ knew that.God, how the sun poured down upon the very spot!The glance was instantaneous.It was a relief to have got free of the room.He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.He went through #Islington; strode up the hill at #Highgate on which stands the stone in honour of #Whittington; turned down to #HighgateHill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the foot-path across the fields, skirted #CaenWood, and so came on #HampsteadHeath.Traversing the hollow by the #Vale of #Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the villages of #Hampstead and #Highgate, made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at #NorthEnd, in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge, and slept.Soon he was up again, and away, -- not far into the country, but back towards #London by the high-road -- then back again -- then over another part of the same ground as he already traversed -- then wandering up and down in fields, and lying on ditches' brinks to rest, and starting up to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again.Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat and drink?#Hendon.That was a good place, not far off, and out of most people's way.Thither he directed his steps, -- running sometimes, and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail's pace, or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick.But when he got there, all the people he met -- the very children at the doors -- seemed to view him with suspicion.Back he turned again, without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the #Heath, uncertain where to go.He wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old place.Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane, and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still lingered about the same spot.At last he got away, and shaped his course for #Hatfield.It was nine o'clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little street, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided them to the spot.There was a fire in the tap-room, and some country-labourers were drinking before it.They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog:to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time.The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted, upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday; the young men present considering him very old, and the old men present declaring him to have been quite young -- not older, one white-haired grandfather said, than he was -- with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least -- if he had taken care; if he had taken care.There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer.This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors, washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a case slung to his back.His entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement.'And what be that stoof?#Good to eat, #Harry?' asked a grinning countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner.'This,' said the fellow, producing one,'this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt, mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen, cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff.Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and invaluable composition.If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she's cured at once -- for it's poison.If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question -- for it's quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it.One penny a square.With all these virtues, one penny a square!'There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly hesitated.The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity.'It's all bought up as fast as it can be made,' said the fellow.'There are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery, always a-working upon it, and they ca n't make it fast enough, though the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned directly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a premium of fifty for twins.One penny a square!Two half-pence is all the same, and four farthings is received with joy.One penny a square! Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains, mud-stains, blood-stains!Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in company, that I'll take clean out, before he can order me a pint of ale.''Hah!' cried #Sikes starting up.'Give that back.''I'll take it clean out, sir,' replied the man, winking to the company,'before you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen all, observe the dark stain upon this gentleman's hat, no wider than a shilling, but thicker than a half-crown.Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain, beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or blood-stain --'The man got no further, for #Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was not followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking past, when he recognised the mail from #London, and saw that it was standing at the little post-office.He almost knew what was to come; but he crossed over, and listened.The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag. A man, dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement.'That's for your people,' said the guard.'Now, look alive in there, will you.#Damn that'ere bag, it war n't ready night afore last; this wo n't do, you know!''Anything new up in town, #Ben?' asked the game-keeper, drawing back to the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses.'No, nothing that I knows on,' replied the man, pulling on his gloves.'Corn's up a little.I heerd talk of a murder, too, down #Spitalfields way, but I do n't reckon much upon it.''Oh, that's quite true,' said a gentleman inside, who was looking out of the window.'And a dreadful murder it was.''Was it, sir?' rejoined the guard, touching his hat.'Man or woman, pray, sir?''A woman,' replied the gentleman.'It is supposed --''Now, #Ben,' replied the coachman impatiently.'Damn that'ere bag,' said the guard;'are you gone to sleep in there?''Coming!' cried the office keeper, running out.'Coming,' growled the guard.'Ah, and so's the young'ooman of property that's going to take a fancy to me, but I do n't know when. Here, give hold.All ri -- ight!'The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.#Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go.At length he went back again, and took the road which leads from #Hatfield to #StA.He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core. Every object before him, substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that morning's ghastly figure following at his heels. He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along.He could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry.If he stopped it did the same. If he ran, it followed -- not running too:that would have been a relief:but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was behind him then.He had kept it before him that morning, but it was behind now -- always.He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky.He threw himself upon the road -- on his back upon the road.At his head it stood, silent, erect, and still -- a living grave-stone, with its epitaph in blood.Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that #Providence must sleep.There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear.There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the night.Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail. He _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched himself close to the wall -- to undergo new torture.For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped.Those widely staring eyes, so lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in themselves, but giving light to nothing.There were but two, but they were everywhere.If he shut out the sight, there came the room with every well-known object -- some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if he had gone over its contents from memory -- each in its accustomed place.The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away.He got up, and rushed into the field without.The figure was behind him. He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once more.The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along.And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting, and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder.Any sound of men in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was something to him.He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open air.The broad sky seemed on fire.Rising into the air with showers of sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood.The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar, and he could hear the cry of #Fire! mingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food.The noise increased as he looked.There were people there -- men and women -- light, bustle.It was like new life to him.He darted onward -- straight, headlong -- dashing through brier and brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered with loud and sounding bark before him.He came upon the spot.There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling down of red-hot beams.The apertures, where doors and windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon the ground.Women and children shrieked, and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers.The clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar.He shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself, plunged into the thickest of the throng.Hither and thither he dived that night:now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest.Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise, nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke and blackened ruins remained.This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the dreadful consciousness of his crime.He looked suspiciously about him, for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject of their talk.The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and they drew off, stealthily, together.He passed near an engine where some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their refreshment.He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen, who were from #London, talking about the murder.'He has gone to #Birmingham, they say,' said one:'but they'll have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there'll be a cry all through the country.'He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep.He wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night.Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to #London.'There's somebody to speak to there, at all event,' he thought.'A good hiding-place, too.They'll never expect to nab me there, after this country scent.Why ca n't I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt from #Fagin, get abroad to #France?#Damme, I'll risk it.'He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination.The dog, though.If any description of him were out, it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him. This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets.He resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went.The animal looked up into his master's face while these preparations were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose, or the robber's sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and cowered as he came more slowly along.When his master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright.'Do you hear me call?Come here!' cried #Sikes.The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as #Sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and started back.'Come back!' said the robber.The dog wagged his tail, but moved not.#Sikes made a running noose and called him again.The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his hardest speed.The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return.But no dog appeared, and at length he resumed his journey.CHAPTER #XLIXMONKS AND #MRB AT #LENGTH MEET.THEIR CONVERSATION, AND #THE #INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS ITThe twilight was beginning to close in, when #MrB alighted from a hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly.The door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side.At a sign from #MrB, they helped out a third man, and taking him between them, hurried him into the house. This man was #Monks.They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and #MrB, preceding them, led the way into a back-room. At the door of this apartment, #Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance, stopped.The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions.'He knows the alternative,' said #MrB.'If he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.''How dare you say this of me?' asked #Monks.'How dare you urge me to it, young man?' replied #MrB, confronting him with a steady look.'Are you mad enough to leave this house?#Unhand him.There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow. But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery.I am resolute and immoveable.If you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your own head!''By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by these dogs?' asked #Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him.'By mine,' replied #MrB.'Those persons are indemnified by me. If you complain of being deprived of your liberty -- you had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it advisable to remain quiet -- I say again, throw yourself for protection on the law.I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed, yourself.'#Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides.He hesitated.'You will decide quickly,' said #MrB, with perfect firmness and composure.'If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a shudder, foresee, I can not control, once more, I say, for you know the way.If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair. It has waited for you two whole days.'#Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.'You will be prompt,' said #MrB.'A word from me, and the alternative has gone for ever.'Still the man hesitated.'I have not the inclination to parley,' said #MrB, #'and, as I advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.''Is there --' demanded Monks with a faltering tongue, --'is there -- no middle course?''None.'#Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the room, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down.'Lock the door on the outside,' said #MrB to the attendants, #'and come when I ring.'The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.'This is pretty treatment, sir,' said #Monks, throwing down his hat and cloak,'from my father's oldest friend.''It is because I was your father's oldest friend, young man,' returned #MrB;'it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man:it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters' death-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would -- but #Heaven willed otherwise -- have made her my young wife; it is because my seared heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you gently now -- yes, #EdwardLeeford, even now -- and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name.''What has the name to do with it?' asked the other, after contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the agitation of his companion.'What is the name to me?''Nothing,' replied #MrB,'nothing to you.But it was _hers_, and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a stranger.I am very glad you have changed it -- very -- very.''This is all mighty fine,' said #Monks (to retain his assumed designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro, and #MrB had sat, shading his face with his hand.'But what do you want with me?''You have a brother,' said #MrB, rousing himself:'a brother, the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither, in wonder and alarm.''I have no brother,' replied #Monks.'You know I was an only child. Why do you talk to me of brothers?You know that, as well as I.''Attend to what I do know, and you may not,' said #MrB.'I shall interest you by and by.I know that of the wretched marriage, into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most unnatural issue.''I do n't care for hard names,' interrupted #Monks with a jeering laugh.'You know the fact, and that's enough for me.''But I also know,' pursued the old gentleman,'the misery, the slow torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. I know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both.I know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume.Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon. But it rusted and cankered at your father's heart for years.''Well, they were separated,' said #Monks,'and what of that?''When they had been separated for some time,' returned #MrB,'and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who, with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new friends.This circumstance, at least, you know already.''Not I,' said #Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything.'Not I.''Your manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,' returned #MrB.'I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty -- for he was, I repeat, a boy, when _his_ father ordered him to marry. Must I go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?''I have nothing to disclose,' rejoined #Monks.'You must talk on if you will.''These new friends, then,' said #MrB,'were a naval officer retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year before, and left him with two children -- there had been more, but, of all their family, happily but two survived. They were both daughters; one a beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two or three years old.''What's this to me?' asked #Monks.'They resided,' said #MrB, without seeming to hear the interruption,'in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode. Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your father was gifted as few men are.He had his sister's soul and person. As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him.I would that it had ended there.His daughter did the same.'The old gentleman paused; #Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed:'The end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a guileless girl.''Your tale is of the longest,' observed #Monks, moving restlessly in his chair.'It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,' returned #MrB,'and such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness, it would be very brief.At length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed, as others are often -- it is no uncommon case -- died, and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him his panacea for all griefs -- Money.It was necessary that he should immediately repair to #Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and where he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion.He went; was seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the intelligence reached #Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he died the day after her arrival, leaving no will -- _no will_ -- so that the whole property fell to her and you.'At this part of the recital #Monks held his breath, and listened with a face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker.As #MrB paused, he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face and hands.'Before he went abroad, and as he passed through #London on his way,' said #MrB, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other's face,'he came to me.''I never heard of that,' interrupted #Monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.'He came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture -- a portrait painted by himself -- a likeness of this poor girl -- which he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty journey.He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself; confided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any loss, into money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition, to fly the country -- I guessed too well he would not fly alone -- and never see it more.Even from me, his old and early friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to both -- even from me he withheld any more particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after that to see me once again, for the last time on earth. #Alas!#_That_ was the last time.I had no letter, and I never saw him more.''I went,' said #MrB, after a short pause,'I went, when all was over, to the scene of his -- I will use the term the world would freely use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him -- of his guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her.The family had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night.Why, or whither, none can tell.'#Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of triumph.'When your brother,' said #MrB, drawing nearer to the other's chair,'When your brother:a feeble, ragged, neglected child:was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy --''What?' cried #Monks.'By me,' said #MrB.'I told you I should interest you before long.I say by me -- I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name, although for ought he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears.When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck me with astonishment.Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream.I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew his history --''Why not?' asked #Monks hastily.'Because you know it well.''I!''Denial to me is vain,' replied #MrB.'I shall show you that I know more than that.''You -- you -- ca n't prove anything against me,' stammered #Monks.'I defy you to do it!''We shall see,' returned the old gentleman with a searching glance.'I lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him.Your mother being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the #WestIndies -- whither, as you well know, you retired upon your mother's death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here -- I made the voyage.You had left it, months before, and were supposed to be in #London, but no one could tell where.I returned.Your agents had no clue to your residence.You came and went, they said, as strangely as you had ever done:sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months:keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy.I wearied them with new applications.I paced the streets by night and day, but until two hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you for an instant.''And now you do see me,' said #Monks, rising boldly,'what then? Fraud and robbery are high-sounding words -- justified, you think, by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man's #Brother! You do n't even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you do n't even know that.''I _did not_,' replied #MrB, rising too;'but within the last fortnight I have learnt it all.You have a brother; you know it, and him.There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death.It contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father.You repaired to the place of his birth. There existed proofs -- proofs long suppressed -- of his birth and parentage.Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, ``_the only proofs of the boy's identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_.'' Unworthy son, coward, liar, -- you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night, -- you, whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you, -- you, who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father's heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mind -- you, #EdwardLeeford, do you still brave me!''No, no, no!' returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated charges.'Every word!' cried the gentleman,'every word that has passed between you and this detested villain, is known to me.Shadows on the wall have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue. #Murder has been done, to which you were morally if not really a party.''No, no,' interposed #Monks.'I -- I knew nothing of that; I was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me.I did n't know the cause.I thought it was a common quarrel.''It was the partial disclosure of your secrets,' replied #MrB.'Will you disclose the whole?''Yes, I will.''Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before witnesses?''That I promise too.''Remain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose of attesting it?''If you insist upon that, I'll do that also,' replied #Monks.'You must do more than that,' said #MrB.'Make restitution to an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love.You have not forgotten the provisions of the will.#Carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned, and then go where you please.In this world you need meet no more.'While #Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it:torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other:the door was hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman (#MrL) entered the room in violent agitation.'The man will be taken,' he cried.'He will be taken to-night!''The murderer?' asked #MrB.'Yes, yes,' replied the other.'His dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is, or will be, there, under cover of the darkness.Spies are hovering about in every direction.I have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture, and they tell me he can not escape.A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government to-night.''I will give fifty more,' said #MrB, #'and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it.Where is Mr. #Maylie?''Harry?As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with you, he hurried off to where he heard this,' replied the doctor, #'and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them.''Fagin,' said #MrB;'what of him?''When I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by this time.They're sure of him.''Have you made up your mind?' asked #MrB, in a low voice, of #Monks.'Yes,' he replied.'You -- you -- will be secret with me?''I will.#Remain here till I return.It is your only hope of safety.'They left the room, and the door was again locked.'What have you done?' asked the doctor in a whisper.'All that I could hope to do, and even more.Coupling the poor girl's intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good friend's inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape, and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day. #Write and appoint the evening after to-morrow, at seven, for the meeting.We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require rest:especially the young lady, who _may_ have greater need of firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now.But my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature.Which way have they taken?''Drive straight to the office and you will be in time,' replied #MrL.'I will remain here.'The two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable.CHAPTER LTHE #PURSUITAND #ESCAPENear to that part of the #Thames on which the church at #Rotherhithe abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close-built low-roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in #London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of its inhabitants.To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion.The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesman's door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows. Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class, ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the raff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along, assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner.Arriving, at length, in streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he has passed, he walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes, chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect.In such a neighborhood, beyond #Dockhead in the Borough of #Southwark, stands #Jacob's #Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called #MillPond, but known in the days of this story as #FollyDitch.It is a creek or inlet from the #Thames, and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the #LeadMills from which it took its old name.At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at #MillLane, will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows, buckets, pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the water up; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him.#Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and threatening to fall into it -- as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the banks of #FollyDitch.In #Jacob's #Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke. Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed. The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die. They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in #Jacob's #Island.In an upper room of one of these houses -- a detached house of fair size, ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window: of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described -- there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation, sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence.One of these was #TobyCrackit, another #MrC, and the third a robber of fifty years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion.This man was a returned transport, and his name was #Kags.'I wish,' said #Toby turning to #MrC,'that you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come here, my fine feller.''Why did n't you, blunder-head!' said #Kags.'Well, I thought you'd have been a little more glad to see me than this,' replied #MrC, with a melancholy air.'Why, look'e, young gentleman,' said #Toby,'when a man keeps himself so very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it's rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman (however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency) circumstanced as you are.''Especially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him, that's arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts, and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,' added #MrK.There was a short silence, after which #TobyCrackit, seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care swagger, turned to #Chitling and said,'When was #Fagin took then?''Just at dinner-time -- two o'clock this afternoon.#Charley and I made our lucky up the wash-us chimney, and #Bolter got into the empty water-butt, head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top, and so they took him too.''And #Bet?''Poor #Bet!She went to see the #Body, to speak to who it was,' replied #Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, #'and went off mad, screaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they put a strait-weskut on her and took her to the hospital -- and there she is.''Wot's come of young Bates?' demanded #Kags.'He hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he'll be here soon,' replied #Chitling.'There's nowhere else to go to now, for the people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken -- I went up there and see it with my own eyes -- is filled with traps.''This is a smash,' observed #Toby, biting his lips.'There's more than one will go with this.''The sessions are on,' said Kags:'if they get the inquest over, and #Bolter turns #King's evidence:as of course he will, from what he's said already:they can prove #Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the trial on on Friday, and he'll swing in six days from this, by G --!''You should have heard the people groan,' said #Chitling;'the officers fought like devils, or they'd have torn him away.He was down once, but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along.You should have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends.I can see'em now, not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst'em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore they'd tear his heart out!'The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro, like one distracted.While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs, and #Sikes's dog bounded into the room.They ran to the window, downstairs, and into the street.The dog had jumped in at an open window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be seen.'What's the meaning of this?' said #Toby when they had returned.'He ca n't be coming here.I -- I -- hope not.''If he was coming here, he'd have come with the dog,' said #Kags, stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor.'Here!Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.''He's drunk it all up, every drop,' said Chitling after watching the dog some time in silence.'Covered with mud -- lame -- half blind -- he must have come a long way.''Where can he have come from!' exclaimed #Toby.'He's been to the other kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here, where he's been many a time and often.But where can he have come from first, and how comes he here alone without the other!''He' -- (none of them called the murderer by his old name) --'He ca n't have made away with himself.What do you think?' said #Chitling.#Toby shook his head.'If he had,' said #Kags,'the dog'ud want to lead us away to where he did it.No.I think he's got out of the country, and left the dog behind.He must have given him the slip somehow, or he would n't be so easy.'This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep, without more notice from anybody.It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and placed upon the table.The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position.They drew their chairs closer together, starting at every sound.They spoke little, and that in whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room.They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below.'Young Bates,' said #Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he felt himself.The knocking came again.No, it was n't he.He never knocked like that.#Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head. There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough. The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door.'We must let him in,' he said, taking up the candle.'Is n't there any help for it?' asked the other man in a hoarse voice.'None.He _must_ come in.''Do n't leave us in the dark,' said #Kags, taking down a candle from the chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.#Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over his head under his hat.He drew them slowly off.#Blanched face, sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days' growth, wasted flesh, short thick breath; it was the very ghost of #Sikes.He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room, but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall -- as close as it would go -- and ground it against it -- and sat down.Not a word had been exchanged.He looked from one to another in silence.If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly averted.When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started. They seemed never to have heard its tones before.'How came that dog here?' he asked.'Alone.Three hours ago.''To-night's paper says that #Fagin's took.Is it true, or a lie?''True.'They were silent again.'Damn you all!' said #Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead.'Have you nothing to say to me?'There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.'You that keep this house,' said #Sikes, turning his face to #Crackit,'do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?''You may stop here, if you think it safe,' returned the person addressed, after some hesitation.#Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him:rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it:and said,'Is -- it -- the body -- is it buried?'They shook their heads.'Why is n't it!' he retorted with the same glance behind him.'Wot do they keep such ugly things above the ground for? -- Who's that knocking?'#Crackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with #CharleyBates behind him.Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure.'Toby,' said the boy falling back, as #Sikes turned his eyes towards him,'why did n't you tell me this, downstairs?'There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad. Accordingly he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with him.'Let me go into some other room,' said the boy, retreating still farther.'Charley!' said #Sikes, stepping forward.'Do n't you -- do n't you know me?''Do n't come nearer me,' answered the boy, still retreating, and looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer's face.'You monster!'The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but #Sikes's eyes sunk gradually to the ground.'Witness you three,' cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and becoming more and more excited as he spoke.'Witness you three -- I'm not afraid of him -- if they come here after him, I'll give him up; I will. I tell you out at once.He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he dares, but if I am here I'll give him up.I'd give him up if he was to be boiled alive.#Murder! Help!If there's the pluck of a man among you three, you'll help me.#Murder!#Help!#Down with him!'Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground.The three spectators seemed quite stupefied.They offered no interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer's breast, and never ceasing to call for help with all his might.The contest, however, was too unequal to last long.#Sikes had him down, and his knee was on his throat, when #Crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm, and pointed to the window.There were lights gleaming below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried footsteps -- endless they seemed in number -- crossing the nearest wooden bridge.One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement.The gleam of lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on. Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.'Help!' shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air.'He's here!#Break down the door!''In the King's name,' cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry arose again, but louder.'Break down the door!' screamed the boy.'I tell you they'll never open it.#Run straight to the room where the light is. #Break down the door!'Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent.'Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell-babe,' cried #Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack.'That door.#Quick!' He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key.'Is the downstairs door fast?''Double-locked and chained,' replied #Crackit, who, with the other two men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.'The panels -- are they strong?''Lined with sheet-iron.''And the windows too?''Yes, and the windows.''Damn you!' cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd.'Do your worst!I'll cheat you yet!'Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng.Some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to shoot him dead.Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water, cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose above all others,'Twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder!'The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it.Some called for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those below; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind:and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar.'The tide,' cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and shut the faces out,'the tide was in as I came up. Give me a rope, a long rope.They're all in front.I may drop into the #FollyDitch, and clear off that way.Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders and kill myself.'The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up to the house-top.All the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up, except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that was too small even for the passage of his body.But, from this aperture, he had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream.He planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose, so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over the low parapet.The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers.Again and again it rose.Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning, took up the sound; it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him.On pressed the people from the front -- on, on, on, in a strong struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion. The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every house-top.Each little bridge (and there were three in sight) bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it.Still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an instant see the wretch.'They have him now,' cried a man on the nearest bridge.'Hurrah!'The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose.'I will give fifty pounds,' cried an old gentleman from the same quarter,'to the man who takes him alive.I will remain here, till he come to ask me for it.'There was another roar.At this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room.The stream abruptly turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left:each man crushing and striving with his neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out. The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation, or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time, between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer, although the universal eagerness for his capture was, if possible, increased.The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet, determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion.Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second.He could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop.At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old gentleman before-mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his position) earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down -- at that very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw his arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror.'The eyes again!' he cried in an unearthly screech.Staggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet.The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his weight, tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds.He fell for five-and-thirty feet.There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand.The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come and take him out, for #God's sake.A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring, jumped for the dead man's shoulders. Missing his aim, he fell into the ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a stone, dashed out his brains.CHAPTER LIAFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING A #PROPOSALOF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN-MONEYThe events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when #Oliver found himself, at three o'clock in the afternoon, in a travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town.#MrsMaylie, and #Rose, and #MrsBedwin, and the good doctor were with him:and #MrB followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned.They had not talked much upon the way; for #Oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree. He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by #MrB with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from #Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense.The same kind friend had, with #MrL's assistance, cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place.'It was quite true,' he said,'that they must know them before long, but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be at a worse.'So, they travelled on in silence:each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together:and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.But if #Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot:a poor houseless, wandering boy, without a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head.'See there, there!' cried #Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of #Rose, and pointing out at the carriage window;'that's the stile I came over; there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake me and force me back!#Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to the old house where I was a little child!Oh #Dick, #Dick, my dear old friend, if I could only see you now!''You will see him soon,' replied #Rose, gently taking his folded hands between her own.'You shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too.''Yes, yes,' said #Oliver,'and we'll -- we'll take him away from here, and have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and well, -- shall we?'#Rose nodded'yes,' for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak.'You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,' said #Oliver.'It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again -- I know that too -- to think how changed he is; you did the same with me.He said ``God bless you'' to me when I ran away,' cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion;'and I will say ``God bless you'' now, and show him how I love him for it!'As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds.There was #Sowerberry's the undertaker's just as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered it -- there were all the well-known shops and houses, with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected -- there was #Gamfield's cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old public-house door -- there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street -- there was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom #Oliver involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so foolish, then cried, then laughed again -- there were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite well -- there was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life had been but a happy dream.But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality.They drove straight to the door of the chief hotel (which #Oliver used to stare up at, with awe, and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size); and here was #MrG all ready to receive them, kissing the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as if he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness, and not offering to eat his head -- no, not once; not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to #London, and maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and that time fast asleep.There was dinner prepared, and there were bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down.#MrBrownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in a separate room.The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present, conversed apart.Once, #MrsMaylie was called away, and after being absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping. All these things made #Rose and #Oliver, who were not in any new secrets, nervous and uncomfortable.They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices.At length, when nine o'clock had come, and they began to think they were to hear no more that night, #MrL and #MrG entered the room, followed by #MrB and a man whom #Oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother, and it was the same man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking in with #Fagin at the window of his little room.Monks cast a look of hate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at the astonished boy, and sat down near the door.#MrB, who had papers in his hand, walked to a table near which #Rose and #Oliver were seated.'This is a painful task,' said he,'but these declarations, which have been signed in #London before many gentlemen, must be in substance repeated here.I would have spared you the degradation, but we must hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.''Go on,' said the person addressed, turning away his face.'Quick.I have almost done enough, I think.Do n't keep me here.''This child,' said #MrB, drawing #Oliver to him, and laying his hand upon his head,'is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your father, my dear friend #EdwinLeeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who died in giving him birth.''Yes,' said #Monks, scowling at the trembling boy:the beating of whose heart he might have heard.'That is the bastard child.''The term you use,' said #MrB, sternly,'is a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It reflects disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass.He was born in this town.''In the workhouse of this town,' was the sullen reply.'You have the story there.'He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke.'I must have it here, too,' said #MrB, looking round upon the listeners.'Listen then!You!' returned #Monks.'His father being taken ill at #Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long separated, who went from #Paris and took me with her -- to look after his property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor he for her.He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he slumbered on till next day, when he died.Among the papers in his desk, were two, dated on the night his illness first came on, directed to yourself'; he addressed himself to #MrB;'and enclosed in a few short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead.One of these papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.''What of the letter?' asked #MrB.'The letter? -- A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her.He had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mystery -- to be explained one day -- prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on, trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what none could ever give her back.She was, at that time, within a few months of her confinement.He told her all he had meant to do, to hide her shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he died, not to curse his memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child; for all the guilt was his.He reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her -- prayed her yet to keep it, and wear it next her heart, as she had done before -- and then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone distracted.I believe he had.''The will,' said #MrB, as #Oliver's tears fell fast.#Monks was silent.'The will,' said #MrB, speaking for him,'was in the same spirit as the letter.He talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature bad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds. The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions -- one for #AgnesFleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come of age.If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong.He did this, he said, to mark his confidence in the other, and his conviction -- only strengthened by approaching death -- that the child would share her gentle heart, and noble nature.If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the money was to come to you:for then, and not till then, when both children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed him with coldness and aversion.''My mother,' said #Monks, in a louder tone,'did what a woman should have done.She burnt this will.The letter never reached its destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the blot.The girl's father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hate -- I love her for it now -- could add.Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of #Wales, changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat; and here, no great while afterwards, he was found dead in his bed.The girl had left her home, in secret, some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home, assured that she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that his old heart broke.'There was a short silence here, until #MrB took up the thread of the narrative.'Years after this,' he said,'this man's -- #EdwardLeeford's -- mother came to me.He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London:where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts.She was sinking under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before she died.Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back with her to #France.''There she died,' said #Monks,'after a lingering illness; and, on her death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved -- though she need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before.She would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born, and was alive.I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by draggin it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot.She was right. He came in my way at last.I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I would have finished as I began!'As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice, #MrB turned to the terrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been his old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping #Oliver ensnared:of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his being rescued:and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him.'The locket and ring?' said #MrB, turning to #Monks.'I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,' answered #Monks without raising his eyes.'You know what became of them.'#MrBrownlow merely nodded to #MrG, who disappearing with great alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in #MrsBumble, and dragging her unwilling consort after him.'Do my hi's deceive me!' cried #MrB, with ill-feigned enthusiasm,'or is that little Oliver?Oh O-li-ver, if you know'd how I've been a-grieving for you --''Hold your tongue, fool,' murmured #MrsBumble.'Is n't natur, natur, #MrsBumble?' remonstrated the workhouse master.'Ca n't I be supposed to feel -- _I_ as brought him up porochially -- when I see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description!I always loved that boy as if he'd been my -- my -- my own grandfather,' said #MrB, halting for an appropriate comparison.'Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat?#Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with plated handles, #Oliver.''Come, sir,' said #MrG, tartly;'suppress your feelings.''I will do my endeavours, sir,' replied #MrB.'How do you do, sir?I hope you are very well.'This salutation was addressed to #MrB, who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple.He inquired, as he pointed to Monks,'Do you know that person?''No,' replied #MrsBumble flatly.'Perhaps _you_ do n't?' said #MrB, addressing her spouse.'I never saw him in all my life,' said #MrB.'Nor sold him anything, perhaps?''No,' replied #MrsBumble.'You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?' said #MrB.'Certainly not,' replied the matron.'Why are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this?'Again #MrB nodded to #MrG; and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness.But not again did he return with a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women, who shook and tottered as they walked.'You shut the door the night old #Sally died,' said the foremost one, raising her shrivelled hand,'but you could n't shut out the sound, nor stop the chinks.''No, no,' said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws.'No, no, no.''We heard her try to tell you what she'd done, and saw you take a paper from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker's shop,' said the first.'Yes,' added the second,'and it was a ``locket and gold ring.'' We found out that, and saw it given you.We were by.Oh! we were by.''And we know more than that,' resumed the first,'for she told us often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.''Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?' asked #MrG with a motion towards the door.'No,' replied the woman;'if he -- she pointed to #Monks --'has been coward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say.I _did_ sell them, and they're where you'll never get them.What then?''Nothing,' replied #MrB,'except that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again. You may leave the room.''I hope,' said #MrB, looking about him with great ruefulness, as #MrG disappeared with the two old women:'I hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office?''Indeed it will,' replied #MrB.'You may make up your mind to that, and think yourself well off besides.''It was all #MrsBumble.She _would_ do it,' urged #MrB; first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.'That is no excuse,' replied #MrB.'You were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction.''If the law supposes that,' said #MrB, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands,'the law is a ass -- a idiot.If that's the eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is, that his eye may be opened by experience -- by experience.'Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, #MrB fixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets, followed his helpmate downstairs.'Young lady,' said #MrB, turning to #Rose,'give me your hand. Do not tremble.You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say.''If they have -- I do not know how they can, but if they have -- any reference to me,' said #Rose,'pray let me hear them at some other time. I have not strength or spirits now.''Nay,' returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his;'you have more fortitude than this, I am sure.Do you know this young lady, sir?''Yes,' replied #Monks.'I never saw you before,' said #Rose faintly.'I have seen you often,' returned #Monks.'The father of the unhappy #Agnes had _two_ daughters,' said #MrB.'What was the fate of the other -- the child?''The child,' replied #Monks,'when her father died in a strange place, in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be traced -- the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it as their own.''Go on,' said #MrB, signing to #MrsMaylie to approach.'Go on!''You could n't find the spot to which these people had repaired,' said #Monks,'but where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way.My mother found it, after a year of cunning search -- ay, and found the child.''She took it, did she?''No.The people were poor and began to sicken -- at least the man did -- of their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a small present of money which would not last long, and promised more, which she never meant to send.She did n't quite rely, however, on their discontent and poverty for the child's unhappiness, but told the history of the sister's shame, with such alterations as suited her; bade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or other.The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed it; and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even to satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at #Chester, saw the girl by chance, pitied her, and took her home.There was some cursed spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy.I lost sight of her, two or three years ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.''Do you see her now?''Yes.Leaning on your arm.''But not the less my niece,' cried #MrsMaylie, folding the fainting girl in her arms;'not the less my dearest child.I would not lose her now, for all the treasures of the world.My sweet companion, my own dear girl!''The only friend I ever had,' cried #Rose, clinging to her.'The kindest, best of friends.My heart will burst.I can not bear all this.''You have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,' said #MrsMaylie, embracing her tenderly.'Come, come, my love, remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child!See here -- look, look, my dear!''Not aunt,' cried #Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck;'I'll never call her aunt -- sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first!#Rose, dear, darling #Rose!'Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred.A father, sister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment.#Joy and grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears:for even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character of pain.They were a long, long time alone.A soft tap at the door, at length announced that some one was without.#Oliver opened it, glided away, and gave place to #HarryMaylie.'I know it all,' he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl.'Dear Rose, I know it all.''I am not here by accident,' he added after a lengthened silence;'nor have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it yesterday -- only yesterday.Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?''Stay,' said #Rose.'You _do_ know all.''All.You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the subject of our last discourse.''I did.''Not to press you to alter your determination,' pursued the young man,'but to hear you repeat it, if you would. I was to lay whatever of station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still adhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or act, to seek to change it.''The same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,' said #Rose firmly.'If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I ever feel it, as I should to-night?It is a struggle,' said #Rose,'but one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.''The disclosure of to-night,' -- #Harry began.'The disclosure of to-night,' replied #Rose softly,'leaves me in the same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.''You harden your heart against me, #Rose,' urged her lover.'Oh #Harry, #Harry,' said the young lady, bursting into tears;'I wish I could, and spare myself this pain.''Then why inflict it on yourself?' said #Harry, taking her hand.'Think, dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.''And what have I heard!What have I heard!' cried #Rose.'That a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all -- there, we have said enough, #Harry, we have said enough.''Not yet, not yet,' said the young man, detaining her as she rose.'My hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling:every thought in life except my love for you:have undergone a change.I offer you, now, no distinction among a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and detraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame; but a home -- a heart and home -- yes, dearest #Rose, and those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.''What do you mean!' she faltered.'I mean but this -- that when I left you last, I left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me; resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine; that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn from it.This I have done.Those who have shrunk from me because of this, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right.Such power and patronage:such relatives of influence and rank:as smiled upon me then, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees in #England's richest county; and by one village church -- mine, #Rose, my own! -- there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of, than all the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold.This is my rank and station now, and here I lay it down!'*****'It's a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,' said #MrG, waking up, and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over his head.#Truth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time. Neither #MrsMaylie, nor #Harry, nor #Rose (who all came in together), could offer a word in extenuation.'I had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,' said #MrG,'for I began to think I should get nothing else.I'll take the liberty, if you'll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.'#MrGrimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by the doctor and #MrBsome people affirm that #HarryMaylie had been observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the best authorities consider this downright scandal:he being young and a clergyman.'Oliver, my child,' said #MrsMaylie,'where have you been, and why do you look so sad?There are tears stealing down your face at this moment.What is the matter?'It is a world of disappointment:often to the hopes we most cherish, and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.#Poor #Dick was dead!CHAPTER #LII#FAGIN'S #LAST NIGHT ALIVEThe court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man -- Fagin.Before him and behind:above, below, on the right and on the left:he seemed to stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes.He stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand resting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was delivering his charge to the jury.At times, he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight in his favour; and when the points against him were stated with terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that he would, even then, urge something in his behalf.#Beyond these manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot.He had scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still.A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself.Looking round, he saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider their verdict. As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising above each other to see his face:some hastily applying their glasses to their eyes:and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of abhorrence.A few there were, who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could delay.But in no one face -- not even among the women, of whom there were many there -- could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be condemned.As he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness came again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the judge.#Hush!They only sought permission to retire.He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was fruitless.The jailer touched him on the shoulder. He followed mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair.The man pointed it out, or he would not have seen it.He looked up into the gallery again.Some of the people were eating, and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very hot.There was one young man sketching his face in a little note-book.He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the artist broke his pencil-point, and made another with his knife, as any idle spectator might have done.In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost, and how he put it on.There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back.He wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner, what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused another.Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could not fix his thoughts upon it.Thus, even while he trembled, and turned burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron spikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was.Then, he thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold -- and stopped to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it -- and then went on to think again.At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all towards the door.The jury returned, and passed him close. He could glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone. #Perfect stillness ensued -- not a rustle -- not a breath -- Guilty.The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another, and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled out, like angry thunder.It was a peal of joy from the populace outside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday.The noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it, and then he only muttered that he was an old man -- an old man -- and so, dropping into a whisper, was silent again.The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the same air and gesture.A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively. The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear. But he stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve.His haggard face was still thrust forward, his under-jaw hanging down, and his eyes staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and beckoned him away.He gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and obeyed.They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard. There was nobody there to speak to _him_; but, as he passed, the prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to the bars:and they assailed him with opprobrious names, and screeched and hissed.He shook his fist, and would have spat upon them; but his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison.Here, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of the condemned cells, and left him there -- alone.He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat and bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to collect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a few disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word.These gradually fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more:so that in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered.To be hanged by the neck, till he was dead -- that was the end.To be hanged by the neck till he was dead.As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means.They rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them.He had seen some of them die, -- and had joked too, because they died with prayers upon their lips.With what a rattling noise the drop went down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of clothes!Some of them might have inhabited that very cell -- sat upon that very spot.It was very dark; why did n't they bring a light?The cell had been built for many years.Scores of men must have passed their last hours there.It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies -- the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath that hideous veil. -- #Light, light!At length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and walls, two men appeared:one bearing a candle, which he thrust into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall:the other dragging in a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more.Then came the night -- dark, dismal, silent night.Other watchers are glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming day.To him they brought despair.The boom of every iron bell came laden with the one, deep, hollow sound -- Death. What availed the noise and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him? It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning.The day passed off.Day?There was no day; it was gone as soon as come -- and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours.At one time he raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair. Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he had driven them away with curses.They renewed their charitable efforts, and he beat them off.Saturday night.He had only one night more to live.And as he thought of this, the day broke -- Sunday.It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim probability of dying so soon. He had spoken little to either of the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention.He had sat there, awake, but dreaming.Now, he started up, every minute, and with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they -- used to such sights -- recoiled from him with horror.He grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together.He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth.His red hair hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that burnt him up. Eight -- nine -- then.If it was not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on each other's heels, where would he be, when they came round again! #Eleven!Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate.At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train; at eleven --Those dreadful walls of #Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as that.The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man was doing who was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they could have seen him.From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received.These being answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the scene.By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness.The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers, painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the pressure of the expected crowd, when #MrB and #Oliver appeared at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner, signed by one of the sheriffs.They were immediately admitted into the lodge.'Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?' said the man whose duty it was to conduct them.'It's not a sight for children, sir.''It is not indeed, my friend,' rejoined #MrB;'but my business with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as well -- even at the cost of some pain and fear -- that he should see him now.'These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to #Oliver. The man touched his hat; and glancing at #Oliver with some curiousity, opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.'This,' said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of workmen were making some preparations in profound silence --'this is the place he passes through.If you step this way, you can see the door he goes out at.'He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the prison food, and pointed to a door.There was an open grating above it, through which came the sound of men's voices, mingled with the noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards.There were putting up the scaffold.From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard, ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row of strong doors on the left hand.Motioning them to remain where they were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys. The two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell.They did so.The condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of a man.His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as a part of his vision.'Good boy, #Charley -- well done --' he mumbled.'Oliver, too, ha! ha! ha! #Oliver too -- quite the gentleman now -- quite the -- take that boy away to bed!'The jailer took the disengaged hand of #Oliver; and, whispering him not to be alarmed, looked on without speaking.'Take him away to bed!' cried #Fagin.'Do you hear me, some of you?He has been the -- the -- somehow the cause of all this.It's worth the money to bring him up to it -- #Bolter's throat, #Bill; never mind the girl -- #Bolter's throat as deep as you can cut.Saw his head off!''Fagin,' said the jailer.'That's me!' cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of listening he had assumed upon his trial.'An old man, my #Lord; a very old, old man!''Here,' said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him down.'Here's somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I suppose.#Fagin, #Fagin!Are you a man?''I sha n't be one long,' he replied, looking up with a face retaining no human expression but rage and terror.'Strike them all dead!What right have they to butcher me?'As he spoke he caught sight of #Oliver and #MrB. Shrinking to the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted there.'Steady,' said the turnkey, still holding him down.'Now, sir, tell him what you want.#Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the time gets on.''You have some papers,' said #MrB advancing,'which were placed in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.''It's all a lie together,' replied #Fagin.'I have n't one -- not one.''For the love of #God,' said #MrB solemnly,'do not say that now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are.You know that #Sikes is dead; that #Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any further gain.Where are those papers?''Oliver,' cried #Fagin, beckoning to him.'Here, here! Let me whisper to you.''I am not afraid,' said #Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished #MrB's hand.'The papers,' said #Fagin, drawing #Oliver towards him,'are in a canvas bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room.I want to talk to you, my dear.I want to talk to you.''Yes, yes,' returned #Oliver.'Let me say a prayer.#Do!Let me say one prayer.Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till morning.''Outside, outside,' replied #Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards the door, and looking vacantly over his head.'Say I've gone to sleep -- they'll believe you.You can get me out, if you take me so. Now then, now then!''Oh!God forgive this wretched man!' cried the boy with a burst of tears.'That's right, that's right,' said #Fagin.'That'll help us on. This door first.If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, do n't you mind, but hurry on.Now, now, now!''Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?' inquired the turnkey.'No other question,' replied #MrB.'If I hoped we could recall him to a sense of his position --''Nothing will do that, sir,' replied the man, shaking his head.'You had better leave him.'The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.'Press on, press on,' cried #Fagin.'Softly, but not so slow. #Faster, faster!'The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging #Oliver from his grasp, held him back.He struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard.It was some time before they left the prison.#Oliver nearly swooned after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not the strength to walk.Day was dawning when they again emerged.A great multitude had already assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking. Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in the centre of all -- the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all the hideous apparatus of death.CHAPTER #LIIIAND #LASTThe fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed. The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple words.Before three months had passed, #RoseFleming and #HarryMaylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman's labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home.#MrsMaylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity that age and worth can know -- the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed.It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of #Monks (which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided between himself and #Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than three thousand pounds.By the provisions of his father's will, #Oliver would have been entitled to the whole; but #MrB, unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to which his young charge joyfully acceded.Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a distant part of the #NewWorld; where, having quickly squandered it, he once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison.As far from home, died the chief remaining members of his friend #Fagin's gang.#MrBrownlow adopted #Oliver as his son.Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the #parsonage-house, where his dear friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of #Oliver's warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world.Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to #Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how.For two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his assistant, took a bachelor's cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered.Here he took to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits of a similar kind:all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity.In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority.Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for #MrG, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated.He is accordingly visited by #MrG a great many times in the course of the year.On all such occasions, #MrG plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right one.On Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman's face:always informing #MrL, in strict confidence afterwards, that he considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say so.It is a standing and very favourite joke, for #MrB to rally him on his old prophecy concerning #Oliver, and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his return; but #MrG contends that he was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that #Oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour.#MrNoah Claypole:receiving a free pardon from the #Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin:and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish:was, for some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work.After some consideration, he went into business as an Informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence.His plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by #Charlotte in respectable attire.The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next day, and pockets half the penalty.Sometimes #MrC faints himself, but the result is the same.#Mr. and #MrsBumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others. #MrB has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife.As to #MrG and #Brittles, they still remain in their old posts, although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey.They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates, and #Oliver and #MrB, and #MrL, that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong.#Master #CharlesBates, appalled by #Sikes's crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best. Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action.He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer's drudge, and a carrier's lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the thread of these adventures.I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it.I would show #RoseMaylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts.I would paint her the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and her dead sister's child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye.These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech -- I would fain recall them every one.How #MrB went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become -- how he traced in him new traits of his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and soothing -- how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them -- these are all matters which need not to be told.I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is #Mercy, and whose great attribute is #Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained.Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble tablet, which bears as yet but one word:'AGNES.'There is no coffin in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed above it!But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love -- the love beyond the grave -- of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of #Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the less because that nook is in a #Church, and she was weak and erring.End of the #ProjectGutenberg EBook of #OliverTwist, by #CharlesDickens*** END OF THIS PROJECT #GUTENBERG EBOOK OLIVER TWIST ******** This file should be named 730.txt or 730.zip ***** This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:http: //www.gutenberg.org/7/3/730/Produced by #PeggyGaugy and #LeighLittle.#HTML version by #AlHaines.#Updated editions will replace the previous one -- the old editions will be renamed.Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a #UnitedStates copyright in these works, so the #Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the #UnitedStates without permission and without paying copyright royalties.Special rules, set forth in the #GeneralTerms of #Use part of this license, apply to copying and distributing #Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the #PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for the #eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy.You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research.They may be modified and printed and given away -- you may do practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.#Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.*** START: FULL LICENSE ***THE #FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU #DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORKTo protect the #Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase ``Project Gutenberg''), you agree to comply with all the terms of the #FullProject Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at http: //gutenberg.net/license).Section 1.General Terms of #Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works1.A.By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright) agreement.If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of #Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
